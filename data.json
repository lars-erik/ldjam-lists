This sentiment analysis is from a [C# implementation](https://github.com/codingupastorm/vadersharp) of [the VADER sentiment analyzer](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and I\u0027m one of two people who have developed an in-review Danish sentiment analyzer, [SentidaV2](https://github.com/esbenkc/emma) along with tools for future development of the Danish sentiment analysis field. It\u0027s quite fun to use this in a game and it becomes a sort of citizen science project as well.",

If you kill the oponent, you gain rest of his life force. Both parties are dealt damage to their healths based on the difference of opponent attack and its own deffense.

        "body":  "So this was my first foray into game jams and LD, and I have to say it was an absolute blast! It\u0027s been quite a while since I\u0027ve last developed any games, so it\u0027s fun to be getting back into it. \n\nMy game is called \"The Light Child\". The main goal of the game is to keep the small fire creature alive (by feeding it wood and protecting it from enemies), all the while also collecting four orbs so that you can rid the world of the darkness it finds itself in. The game is definitely on the harder side, but if you\u0027re up for a challenge, then this game is for you!\n\nControls:\n- Move with arrow keys\n- Pickup/drop items with space bar\n- \u0027z\u0027 to attack with the axe, or to feed the fire child wood pieces\n- esc to pause\n\nThe game was made using Godot and all art was made in Aseprite (both of which I only starting learning on Friday :sweat_smile:). Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t get around to adding any music :(\n\nI look forwards to participating in future Ludum Dares, and hope you all have fun playing my game!\n\n![img1.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c836.png)\n\n![img4.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c83d.png)\n\n![img3.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c84b.png)",

If you leave her alone for a while, she will not take care of herself. What a lazy bum! Everyone needs sleep and that includes Luda. She\u0027s asleep from 11pm to 7am.\n\n## Controls ð®\nclick the buttons to take care of Luda. Click the screen to switch camera angles. In the bottom left there\u0027s a reset button.\n\n## Features ð¡\n- A day night cycle based on real time\n- Dialog feedback\n- The instruments in the musical arrangement become more dissonant upon deprivation\n\n---\n\n# Development\n\n## Missed Features ð\nSome features that were planned but couldn\u0027t be made in time:\n- More facial expressions for different interactions.\n- Blinking of the eyes\nI started very late and had only 15min left to spare in the end. This is not a lot of work but it\u0027s still too much to achieve in 15 minutes. Originally I also planned for Luda to take potty breaks but I scrapped that entirely.\n\n## Tools Used ð \nAudio:\n- Audacity\n- Mulab\n\nDevelopment:\n- Unity\n- MonoDevelop\n\nOther:\n- Clip Studio Paint\n- Cheetah 3D\n- Screenflow (for the time lapse)\n\n## Disclaimer â¼ï¸\nThe compo states one has to work alone but unfortunately I can not provide voice overs for female characters. I asked a friend to do the voice acting.\n\n## Time Lapse ð°",

        "body":  "Well. You are a simple man, with simple taste. You love your flower pots out in the sun. But it\u0027s hot. Like REALLY hot. So you have to constantly water your plants so they don\u0027t die. You gain points by keeping your plants alive and lose points by letting them die (not taking into account the emotional damage of seeing your plant buddies WILT IN THE SUN). Make sure to refill your watering can often so you don\u0027t run out of water.\n\nMultiplayer Mode: (This mode is REALLY the most fun / heart of the game. It can even get quite tactical, but PLEASE don\u0027t let it end like the average game of \"Mario Party\"...)\n\nPlants belong to the person who last watered it. This means they grant points to this player while alive, but also deduce points when dying. Try to score the most points by shoving and keeping the other player from watering and keeping your own plants alive.\n\nControls:\n\nPlayer 1:\nw, a, s, d / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\nspace / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\nleft ctrl / b-button: shove the other player\n\nPlayer 2:\nup,down,left,right / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\nright ctrl / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\nkeypad 0 / b-button: shove the other player\n\nSelect stages by clicking on them. Return to menu by pressing Escape. Gamepad support is through SDL2. All major gamepads like 360 should work. My crappy age old ps1 ripoff controllers worked :-D .\n\nThis game was made with my very own handcrafted 2D Game Engine, called the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine). Web Build is brand new, hope it works everywhere. Gamepad support is probably missing on web build, what was to be expected.\n",

Introducing Magic Atoth, the perfect breed of pet!\n\nGeneticists here at the Atoth company have been hard at work researching and experimenting to figure out the formula for the ideal pet experience, and this cute little thing is the result of years of dedication towards the cause! Now, there\u0027s no need to choose between any of the thousands of other pets out there, just select the one that\u0027s made to be perfect!\n\nBut wait, there\u0027s more! While a regular pet may be a money-sucking machine, requiring specialized food, care and living standards, Magic Atoth eliminates the need to worry about money by being able to live in any condition! It can eat any type of food, including the stuff you don\u0027t want, and only needs water in addition with that in order to survive, and live happily! In fact, we don\u0027t even charge you money to get one, we\u0027re giving them away free to anyone who wants them!\n\nThere\u0027s just one requirement:\n\n**Keep it alive.**",

        "body":  "An online multiplayer (no limit to players) 3D variant of [Conway\u0027s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), where human players control special cells that can move around the game of life board between the generations and influence the surrounding cells. The goal is to keep your cell alive for as many generations as possible. Despite having the magical ability to move around the board between the generations your cell is bound to the same rules as the other cells in the game; it will die if it is not alongside **exactly** two or three neighbouring cells when the next generation is computer.\n\nTo add to the challenge your cell has a finite amount of energy that can only be replenished by occupying a space with an energy bolt when the next generation is calculated, so you can\u0027t just sit around on a stable part of the board.\n\nThere is an additional option to have a bird\u0027s eye view of the board if you\u0027d like to watch the magic unfold.\n\nThis is my first submission to Ludum Dare. I\u0027m not an artist so I just used very basic primitives and tried to do my best. I wanted to do more with the audio but this was my first time using Tone.js and it was a bit of a learning curve for me.\n\nThe backend is a node.js server running on an Ubuntu server, but was developed on a Windows 10 PC using Visual Studio 2019. I started the code on the morning of Saturday, April 18th, 2020 and put the final version up on my server around 5:30pm CST on the 19th. I was considering submitting this as Compo but I did use Bootstrap and FontAwesome for the UI overlays which might disqualify me from Compo.\n\n**NOTE** I am hosting the game on my own server [https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/](https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/) with a self-signed certificate so you\u0027ll likely get a security warning you\u0027ll have to go through to play.\n\n",

It\u0027s been quite a while since I\u0027ve last developed any games, so it\u0027s fun to be getting back into it. \n\nMy game is called \"The Light Child\". The main goal of the game is to keep the small fire creature alive (by feeding it wood and protecting it from enemies), all the while also collecting four orbs so that you can rid the world of the darkness it finds itself in. The game is definitely on the harder side, but if you\u0027re up for a challenge, then this game is for you!\n\nControls:\n- Move with arrow keys\n- Pickup/drop items with space bar\n- \u0027z\u0027 to attack with the axe, or to feed the fire child wood pieces\n- esc to pause\n\nThe game was made using Godot and all art was made in Aseprite (both of which I only starting learning on Friday :sweat_smile:). Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t get around to adding any music :(\n\nI look forwards to participating in future Ludum Dares, and hope you all have fun playing my game!\n\n![img1.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c836.png)\n\n![img4.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c83d.png)\n\n![img3.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c84b.png)",

        "body":  "Well. You are a simple man, with simple taste. You love your flower pots out in the sun. But it\u0027s hot. Like REALLY hot. So you have to constantly water your plants so they don\u0027t die. You gain points by keeping your plants alive and lose points by letting them die (not taking into account the emotional damage of seeing your plant buddies WILT IN THE SUN). Make sure to refill your watering can often so you don\u0027t run out of water.\n\nMultiplayer Mode: (This mode is REALLY the most fun / heart of the game. It can even get quite tactical, but PLEASE don\u0027t let it end like the average game of \"Mario Party\"...)\n\nPlants belong to the person who last watered it. This means they grant points to this player while alive, but also deduce points when dying. Try to score the most points by shoving and keeping the other player from watering and keeping your own plants alive.\n\nControls:\n\nPlayer 1:\nw, a, s, d / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\nspace / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\nleft ctrl / b-button: shove the other player\n\nPlayer 2:\nup,down,left,right / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\nright ctrl / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\nkeypad 0 / b-button: shove the other player\n\nSelect stages by clicking on them. Return to menu by pressing Escape. Gamepad support is through SDL2. All major gamepads like 360 should work. My crappy age old ps1 ripoff controllers worked :-D .\n\nThis game was made with my very own handcrafted 2D Game Engine, called the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine). Web Build is brand new, hope it works everywhere. Gamepad support is probably missing on web build, what was to be expected.\n",

If you leave her alone for a while, she will not take care of herself. What a lazy bum! Everyone needs sleep and that includes Luda. She\u0027s asleep from 11pm to 7am.\n\n## Controls ð®\nclick the buttons to take care of Luda. Click the screen to switch camera angles. In the bottom left there\u0027s a reset button.\n\n## Features ð¡\n- A day night cycle based on real time\n- Dialog feedback\n- The instruments in the musical arrangement become more dissonant upon deprivation\n\n---\n\n# Development\n\n## Missed Features ð\nSome features that were planned but couldn\u0027t be made in time:\n- More facial expressions for different interactions.\n- Blinking of the eyes\nI started very late and had only 15min left to spare in the end. This is not a lot of work but it\u0027s still too much to achieve in 15 minutes. Originally I also planned for Luda to take potty breaks but I scrapped that entirely.\n\n## Tools Used ð \nAudio:\n- Audacity\n- Mulab\n\nDevelopment:\n- Unity\n- MonoDevelop\n\nOther:\n- Clip Studio Paint\n- Cheetah 3D\n- Screenflow (for the time lapse)\n\n## Disclaimer â¼ï¸\nThe compo states one has to work alone but unfortunately I can not provide voice overs for female characters. I asked a friend to do the voice acting.\n\n## Time Lapse ð°",

Introducing Magic Atoth, the perfect breed of pet!\n\nGeneticists here at the Atoth company have been hard at work researching and experimenting to figure out the formula for the ideal pet experience, and this cute little thing is the result of years of dedication towards the cause! Now, there\u0027s no need to choose between any of the thousands of other pets out there, just select the one that\u0027s made to be perfect!\n\nBut wait, there\u0027s more! While a regular pet may be a money-sucking machine, requiring specialized food, care and living standards, Magic Atoth eliminates the need to worry about money by being able to live in any condition! It can eat any type of food, including the stuff you don\u0027t want, and only needs water in addition with that in order to survive, and live happily! In fact, we don\u0027t even charge you money to get one, we\u0027re giving them away free to anyone who wants them!\n\nThere\u0027s just one requirement:\n\n**Keep it alive.**",

        "body":  "An online multiplayer (no limit to players) 3D variant of [Conway\u0027s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), where human players control special cells that can move around the game of life board between the generations and influence the surrounding cells. The goal is to keep your cell alive for as many generations as possible. Despite having the magical ability to move around the board between the generations your cell is bound to the same rules as the other cells in the game; it will die if it is not alongside **exactly** two or three neighbouring cells when the next generation is computer.\n\nTo add to the challenge your cell has a finite amount of energy that can only be replenished by occupying a space with an energy bolt when the next generation is calculated, so you can\u0027t just sit around on a stable part of the board.\n\nThere is an additional option to have a bird\u0027s eye view of the board if you\u0027d like to watch the magic unfold.\n\nThis is my first submission to Ludum Dare. I\u0027m not an artist so I just used very basic primitives and tried to do my best. I wanted to do more with the audio but this was my first time using Tone.js and it was a bit of a learning curve for me.\n\nThe backend is a node.js server running on an Ubuntu server, but was developed on a Windows 10 PC using Visual Studio 2019. I started the code on the morning of Saturday, April 18th, 2020 and put the final version up on my server around 5:30pm CST on the 19th. I was considering submitting this as Compo but I did use Bootstrap and FontAwesome for the UI overlays which might disqualify me from Compo.\n\n**NOTE** I am hosting the game on my own server [https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/](https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/) with a self-signed certificate so you\u0027ll likely get a security warning you\u0027ll have to go through to play.\n\n",

There are bandits, gangs and desperate loners who all need food, clothes and shelter to survive.

People have gathered in commune shelters, trying to restart some kind of society, but most of them have since been raided or just started in-fighting which quickly escalated to mass murder.\n\nYou are the leader of a small band of people, all scared and desperate. One of your good friends, may he rest in piece, shared a secret with you before he passed: somewhere in the \"Three Sisters\" mountains, there is a hidden commune which has both food and shelter. As a last resort, you have set out for this commune, and you now stand before the \"Three Sisters\".\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\nThe Three Sisters is an interactive novel where you have to keep your party alive and find shelter in the mountains.

Return with enough food (and often) to save your friend.\n\n# Controls\n**A** and **D** to move left and right  \n**Space** to jump  \n**Left Click**/**Left Control** to shoot  \n**F** to melee  \n**E** to interact  \n**C** to eat to recover health\n\nI liked this concept of having to take care of someone and not really have an idea of how well they are doing when you are out. I felt like while playing it gave a sense of urgency and fear that you could come home and find your friend dead. If I had more time I would like to have put in some more metroidvania aspects, like puzzles and power ups that would unlock new areas. I think it could work well as a full game (with much better balancing).\n\nThank you for playing!",

Spend your resources wisely to repair and add cannons to the hull of the ship.   \n\nThis is a very quick piece after taking a few years off of game development. I had a lot of fun with this one for sure. I took inspiration from the first boss in Contra (NES) wondering what it would be like to play the defense wall rather than the players. I had stretch goals of adding more sound effects, multiple turrets, power cores to shield tiles, and a chatty AI that runs the station, but had to scale these items back to make the deadline. \n\n\n\nSimply click and build and make your way to the Eden Outpost where you and your crew will be safe!\n\n\n\nThanks for check out my game.\n\nMatt![Shadows_Cover.png](///raw/2ce/z/2c639.png)",

        "body":  "# Welcome to the Future!\n\nSociety thrives thanks to nearly unlimited power generated by **GIANT TURBINES** in the sky... Turbines **DEGRADE** over time. It\u0027s your job to keep them **WORKING.**  Use the **Robo-Launcher 2034** and see how long you can keep the turbines **ALIVE**!\n\n![Title.PNG](///raw/03a/d/z/2c233.png)\n\n---\n\n## Downloads and Links:\n* WebGL: https://fussenkuh.itch.io/turbine-troubles\n* Source: Available to download at the WebGL link\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nOverall, I\u0027m happy with what I\u0027ve accomplished. I learned some new (to me) Unity techniques and brought a new game into the world... all in the span of 48 hours. I\u0027d call that a win! I\u0027m looking forward to checking out everyone\u0027s submissions :)\n\nI didn\u0027t have the full weekend to dedicate to The Jam. Considering the time constraints, I wanted to keep the game\u0027s scope small. Needless to say, the actual code leaves a bit to be desired. 24 hours means it\u0027s time to throw out my software engineering best practices and just start hacking.\n\nWhen played on the Web, I\u0027ve noticed that, on occasion, the background music doesn\u0027t always start playing and the audio, in general, tends to pop. If you experience music drop-out, try reloading the web page and/or pressing the [ESC] key to reload the game.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity 2019.2\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n* \u002798 Fender Toronado\n* The Google Machine\n\n---",

There\u0027s only 3 levels with 3 waves each.\n- This is obviously not a complete thing on its own but it serves as a proof of concept for a type of game like this.",

You might also find it more enjoyable to put your browser in full screen mode.\n\nThis runs on WebAssembly - if you have a modern browser (i.e. not I.E.) it should just run. It may take a bit to load all of the assets, but after it finishes loading, it will run entirely locally. It might take a few seconds for anything to happen - do not lose hope too fast if all you see if a empty screen!",

Protect the queen at all cost!\n\n# Controls\n\n* __Moving the Camera__ use the arrow keys or right mouse button \n\n* __Creating ants__ use the \"actions\" menu in the bottom left corner _only works if you have any eggs available_\n\n* __Building rooms__ use the \"build\" menu in the bottom right corner, click to confirm\n\n# Score\n\n* You\u0027ll gain 1 point for each second that the colony survives.\n\n* Each collected food item grants 30 points.\n\n# Types of ants\n\n* __Queen__ the most important of them all. You\u0027ll lose the game if she dies. She can lay eggs by using the \"lay eggs\" action in the action menu (_if there\u0027s one or more empty nurseries available_).\n![QueenAnt.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c307.png)\n\n* __Soldier__ wanders around the hive. Has increased health and damage. Useful for fending off attackers.\n![SoldierAnt.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c2f2.png)\n\n* __Forager__ digs tunnels under the surface and searches for food. When food is found it will be caried to a storage room if there is one available.\n![ForagerAnt.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c309.png)\n\n* __Builder__ digs tunnels and constructs rooms. You\u0027ll need at least 1 builder to construct rooms.\n![BuilderAnt.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c30b.png)\n\n# Rooms\n\n* __Nursery__ houses eggs, which can be laid by the queen. You\u0027ll need at least 1 nursery to lay eggs.\n![NurseryRoom.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c31d.png)\n\n* __Queen Room__ houses the queen. The queen will return here after laying eggs.\n![QueensRoom.png](///raw/f75/c/z/2c31f.png)\n\n* __Storage__ drop off point for foragers.

You are given a plot of empty land and a little bit of money, and your job is to build up a forest.  Use the money you are given to place plants and animals, earning more money with each living thing in your forest.  But be careful: will the rabbit you just added reproduce out of control and wipe out your vegetation, or will the wolves hunt them to extinction?  Can you keep your forest growing, and more importantly, can you keep it alive?\n\nThis is my first ever game jam submission.  I have been teaching myself to code as a hobby for the past two years or so, and while I am certainly no artist or game designer, I\u0027m excited to have completed a project and get your feedback!\n\nCreated Using:\nUnity Engine 2019.3.0f6\nPhotoshop\nReaper w/ Native Instruments",

        "body":  "First, a .gif to start off things...\n![lia-short.gif](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c6ec.gif)\n\nIn the midst of shelter-in-home, I\u0027ve been watching a reality show called _Love is Blind_ like many other consumers.\nIn addition to that, I\u0027ve been watching \"Couples Therapist Reacts to Love is Blind\" on YouTube and it\u0027s been surprisingly insightful! [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRot2oCPvjI) \n\nHaving been shut in with my spouse for over a month now, I am increasingly thankful for vulnerable moments, and aware of walls that we put up when we are unhappy.\n\nThis game is a playful take on what I guess some couples therapists do in their job -- sort through anger, defenses, and find the true emotions and make sure there\u0027s two way communication.\n\nIn addition, I just wanted to experiment with procedurally generated maps, so that\u0027s what this ended up being. Just a one screen game about a couples therapy session. \n\nI didn\u0027t have too much time to polish up the letters, so you might find it not perfect -- but if you had watched _Love Is Blind_, I think you might recognize some of the sentiments!\n\nA longer gif:\n\n![lia.gif](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c708.gif)\n\nMore screenshots:\n\n![2020-04-19 17_22_22-LD46 - main - WebGL - Unity 2019.2.10f1 Personal [PREVIEW PACKAGES IN USE] _DX11.png](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c590.png)\n\n![2020-04-19 17_22_53-LD46 - main - WebGL - Unity 2019.2.10f1 Personal [PREVIEW PACKAGES IN USE] _DX11.png](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c593.png)",

I missed making games so much!\n\n![title.png](///raw/a8a/f2/z/2c719.png)\n\n## Intro\nOnce upon a time there were some clans\n\nGod of Death wants them to fight and die. Self destruction is the nature anyway.\n\nYou, God of Life, want to keep them ALIVE!\n\nBut for how long?\n\n## How to play?\n*Rules:*\n- You indirectly control the clans\u0027 behavior by placing food\n- Try to keep them from killing each other as long as you can\n- Or don\u0027t, just watch them fight!\n\n*Controls:*\n- Left click to spawn food\n- Use mouse wheel to zoom the camera in and out\n- Right click and drag to rotate the camera view\n- There is useful info in HUD, you can also check the box \"abundant food\" to auto-generate, well, abundant, food.\n\n## Screenshots\nThe static images of this game is far far less interesting than the actual game!\n\n![Screenshot (44).png](///raw/a8a/f2/z/2c721.png)\n^ 3 little clans\n\n![Screenshot (67).png](///raw/a8a/f2/z/2c6fe.png)\n^ Clans running for food\n\n## Known bugs\n- If you look straight down from above, camera would glitch.\n\n## P.S.\nI really can\u0027t compose by myself so this game has no music. Enjoy the visual though!\n\n## P.S. #2\nWhy is it called alive.io? A friend spotted that the colors I used in this game is very similar to those used in io games, and the mechanic of factions fight each other is similar too! So why not just name it io :p :stuck_out_tongue: \n\n## Credits\n- [bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) was used for generating sound effects for this game.",

You must navigate star systems and collect essential resources to keep your crew alive. You have a very limited supply of fuel, oxygen, and food. Jump between systems and land on planets and rings to collect resources. Different planets yield different resources (fuel, oxygen, food) and some are more abundant than others. Eventually, safely reach a space station and bring your ship to safety. \n\nEach system is randomly generated, and planet surfaces are randomly generated. Use arrow keys to move ship and player around.\n\nWritten in Golang using Ebiten. I tried to get a WebGL version but the planetary generation does not work nice in a browser :(. I have versions for Windows and MacOS. Ultimately this was fun because Ebiten is such a simple game library, and I ended up spending a lot of time writing my own viewports, collisions and scene system on top of building the game. It could definitely use some more polish but I\u0027m still proud of what I did in 48 hours. \n\nDemo:\n![demo.gif](///raw/088/81/z/2c595.gif)",

Using the last of the stock, you can build defences to protect yourself from the hoards of angry customers. For how many business days can you keep yourself alive?\n\nA retro-style tower defence game, where you protect yourself from bunches of angry customers in the supermarket.\n\n### Gameplay\n\nAll you need is a mouse!\n\nA bunch of customers will come to attempt to siege the supermarket each day. The hoards get bigger each day, so you need to buy and build items from the catalogue to help defend yourself.\n\nHover over the items in the catalogue to find out more about them, and click them to purchase them.\nThe green spots will tell you where you can place your defences - click on them to place your item!\nAfter placing a defence there is a cool-down period before you can place it again.\n\nYou get payed by the hour, and each morning you get a daily bonus of extra cash and an increased wage!\n\nYou can also use perks to increase the effectiveness of your turrets, but these only last for the duration of the day you bought them on.\n\n### Images\n![thumbnail.png](///raw/6a6/e1/z/2c328.png)\n![screenshot.png](///raw/6a6/e1/z/2c4db.png)\n\n### What I used to make it\n\nProgrammed in Python using Pygame.\nAll art was drawn in GIMP.\nMusic was created using Beepbox (https://beepbox.co/).\nSound effects generated in the fabulous SFXR (http://drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).\n\n",

The maze isn\u0027t happy with simply trapping souls. You need to keep openings available to give the victims hope.\n\n\n\nControls: Mouse only\n\nPost-jam notes:\n- I think this came out pretty funny. The further you get, the more out of control everything becomes.\n- I think it could be a neat idea, but my execution here could have been a lot better.\n- I would have liked to have saved some time with the AI by just keeping it simple. It didn\u0027t end up working as well I\u0027d have liked.\n- Biggest missed feature I think would be something to make it clearer where you can and can\u0027t place walls. It\u0027s pretty difficult going in blind if you\u0027re having trouble working why you can\u0027t click in many places.\n- I missed out on audio, but given my busy life-schedule, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have time anyway. It kind of works without audio, but I would have liked more juice and polish.\n- The 3rd upgrade is broken, ignore it.\n\n\nAll criticism is welcomed.",

These parts include weapons, cameras, CPUs, movement systems, power supplies, etc. Certain weapons, for example, shotguns, rocket launchers, and chainsaws, break individual parts, which means that it is more difficult to salvage new equipment from the enemies you kill. Other weapons, such as tasers and lightning guns, can disable enemies without damaging their parts, guaranteeing that all of their parts will be fully intact and ready for you to salvage.\n\nIf you ever see an enemy that has an extremely powerful weapon or is capable of moving at extreme speeds, it is *always possible* to kill it and steal its weapon or movement system. *Every single weapon, movement system, or type of vision in the game is available for the player to use,* as long as you can kill the enemy.\n\nIf an enemy damages one of your parts while you\u0027re using it or you take a broken part from an enemy, you can still use that part, but it will have major penalties.\n\n*Weapons* - Broken weapons will fire at half the rate and will be less accurate.\n\n*Movement* - Broken movement systems cause you to move at half the speed that they would normally allow.\n\n*Camera* - A broken camera will periodically suddenly move, making aiming harder.\n\n*CPU* - CPUs kill you if you have one that has been broken for 10 seconds.\n\n*Power* - Power supplies kill you if you have one that has been broken for a full minute.\n\n![shoot.png](///raw/370/02/z/2ba2d.png)\n\n## Controls\n\nWASD to move\n\nLeft click to shoot in the direction of the mouse\n\nScroll wheel or F to switch between your primary and secondary weapons\n\nE to interact with dead enemies, as long as you are standing on top of them\n\n## Menu\n\n![menu.png](///raw/370/02/z/2ba4b.png)\n\nTo swap one of your components with the enemy\u0027s corresponding component, click it. To see the description for a part, hover over it, and its description will appear in the bottom left box. Broken parts will be colored bright red. Broken CPUs and power supplies will fade from white to red, and when they are red, it means that they are completely broken and will kill anything that they are placed in.",

If they max out their needs in any way they can lose health. Health cannot be regained. If your buddy eats too much, they will become overweight and lose health. \n\nPlay with them to exercise and lose that weight. If they become too dirty they will become sick and will need medication.\n\nA pill can be bought with enough gold.\nYou can acquire gold by digging their poop away. This will also lessen the chance of your buddy staying in it. Staying in poop will accelerate your hygiene levels.\n\nI recommend downloading it, if you can. It looks better and plays better.

Fail too many times and, well, it\u0027s lights out.\n\n![ld6.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c301.png)\n\n**Hacking is Probably Not Like This** contains **at least 11 puzzle games** (and **less than 13**) for you to enjoy, and lets you live out the dream of enacting **10 kinds of justice** to a **randomly generated list of over a hundred corporations**.\n\nIt is playable both on the **web** (in HTML5) and **Windows**, and you can find the **links at the bottom of this page**.\n\n![ld8.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c2f4.png)\n\n_**Hacking**_ was developed solely by myself in Godot over 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 46 Compo (Keep it Alive). \n\nIt is controlled with the arrow keys to move, and the Z key to select (with P to pause), and features autosave capability. It also features background imagery taken from my room, my desk full of anime stuff, and a nearby river which normally looks real nice, but currently is kind of brown.\n\nThere is no sound (sorry!), but feel free to put on your best lo-fi beats to hack/cyberpunk to. The font used for the game is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata).\n\n_**Hacking**_ is my second release under the label **300g curry lab**, a sub-label of my indie game circle **[300g curry rice](http://300g.megane-moe.com/)**. We make all sorts of indie games celebrating mixes of anime homage and nostalgic game remake, and I\u0027d be plenty pleased to have you either follow [my circle](https://twitter.com/300g_curry_rice) or [myself](http://canon.megane-moe.com) (invelica - previously sayumeki) on Twitter.\n\nThanks for your time! Happy hacking!",

        "body":  "About\n-----\nThe Supreme Beings demand offerings to avoid everything from being destroyed. They\u0027re fussy about them as well, and demand a specific offering from you, the Novice Adulator. Find the right one and deliver it to the place of adulation, so the Supreme Beings don\u0027t destroy everything. While you\u0027re wandering around, talk to some of the locals and find out what they think about their overlords. Avoid the gaze of The Watchers who do not like Adulators. They can look vertically and horizontally, but can\u0027t look through blocks.\n\nTo Play\n-------\nControl your character with the arrow keys.\nArrow keys do everything in this game - move and interact with objects and characters.\nIf in doubt just press the arrow keys!\n\nMy idea\n-------\nI wanted to create a retro style maze game in Bitsy with more game play than my previous Bitsy games. I managed to include a couple of puzzles in it. (1) Choosing the right offering based on a sequence puzzle at the top of the screen. (2) Choosing the right paths through The Watcher rooms. I had other puzzle ideas, but ran out of time. Originally I planned to create the mazes, text and tiles/sprites/items with a tool I\u0027d developed to generate them randomly, but that didn\u0027t work out. However, most of the graphics are tweaked versions of the original random tiles, and a lot of the character and item text was randomly generated as well.\n\nThanks to Adam Le Doux for creating Bitsy.\n\n![LDJam Bitsy gif.gif](///raw/fa2/3/z/2c491.gif)\n\n![bitsy ldjam april2020 screen3.png](///raw/fa2/3/z/2c496.png)\n",

Crops can be revived if there are enough live plants near them.\n\n- Berries will only form if Conway\u0027s plant can sustain in place for 3 days or longer.\n\n\n\nTips:\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns\n this wikipedia might come in handy ;)\n\n\nKnown bugs:\n\n- Dead plants will reset to first stage when coming back alive.\n\nAdditional resources used:\n\n- Super Mario 2 font https://www.dafont.com/super-mario-bros-2.font\n\n\n\nNotes: This was pretty rushed due to having roughly only 20 hours of the 48 hour jam to make a thing... it shows.",

If they max out their needs in any way they can lose health. Health cannot be regained. If your buddy eats too much, they will become overweight and lose health. \n\nPlay with them to exercise and lose that weight. If they become too dirty they will become sick and will need medication.\n\nA pill can be bought with enough gold.\nYou can acquire gold by digging their poop away. This will also lessen the chance of your buddy staying in it. Staying in poop will accelerate your hygiene levels.\n\nI recommend downloading it, if you can. It looks better and plays better. It also has a much bigger screensize.\n\n\n![New project 20_04_2020 01.50.23.png](///raw/6d3/a/z/2c53c.png)\n\nSleepy buddy\n![sleep.png](///raw/6d3/a/z/2c57a.png)",

You and your joystick. *You have to keep the whale alive!*\n\n![2020-04-20 01.38.56.jpg](///raw/b88/z/2c3f5.jpg)\n\nThe [Atari 2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) (also known as Atari VCS, which is confusing as there\u0027s a recent product with that name), released in 1977 was one of the first home consoles. This is a game for that platform. A game about a whale that you need to guide so it avoids obstacles while it falls towards its home in the ocean.\n\n## Instructions\n\n**[Play it on the Javatari emulator online](https://javatari.org/?ROM=http://public.librador.com/whale-1.0.rom) or [Download the ROM to play on native emulator or real hardware](http://public.librador.com/whale-1.0.rom).**\n\nSelect level with left and right on the joystick. There are 3 levels. Press the fire button to start.\n\nMake the whale go left and right with the joystick. If the whale hits something, you get one more chance, but if it happens again, it\u0027s bye-bye, whale! :cry:\n\nYou succeed if you manage to guide the whale all the way to the blue sea.\n\n## Known issues\n\n  * The graphics on the level selection screen is misaligned on some platforms. It does not happen in the online emulators I have tested it on, but it can be seen in Stella 5.1.1 and on my Atari 2600.\n\n  * Sorry for sounding like a graphical artist, but on my Atari and TV set, the colors are very different from the emulators. Maybe because the TV doesn\u0027t handle the NTSC signal properly. Or maybe just because by poor Atari is very old.",

That build features a music loop made by me instead of the one by Faizyr used in the main build.** That\u0027s the only difference between that build and the others.\n\n```\nInstructions.-\n```\n\n**These are all included in game. You control the main character with either the arrow keys or A/D. You can pause the game pressing space. The game will end once you find the 20 birds.**\n\nThe game should activate fullscreen after the intro, **I recommend playing it on fullscreen**. You can also activate fullscreen using the icon on the right bottom corner (on the browser version) or pressing F on the desktop version.\n\n```\nMisc.-\n```\n\n**This game is harder than the ones I usually make**. Took me 4 minutes and 10 deaths to complete the last build before releasing it, then again, I had been practising for two days. Once you get to the end the game will show how many times you have died. ",

        "body":  "_ Hello fellow Developers and Gamers!_ \n\n**First** let me start with this! I was aware about **Ludum Dare** for a long time, but I never participated in it. That changed this weekend :smile: ! I finally decided to give this event a go and to try to develop a game in Unity! I have messed around with Unity before, but I never managed to \"produce\" something. That changed today as I\u0027ve just \"finished\" my first \"game\" in it -\u003e **Keep E.T Alive**.\n\nSo as name of the game suggest I **followed** the idea of the **theme** ... perhaps too much :smile:. E.T has returned from his home planet back to Earth. He realized that he is missing some of the finest things from Earth - such as _Beer_ or _Meat_. But he is very exhausted from the trip so you need to keep him alive! Feed him, don\u0027t let him be thirsty and also clean after him. He may occasionally start to bleed as he is adjusting to earthly atmosphere again, so take care of that too!\n\n![e.t.png](///raw/d4b/03/z/2c447.png)\n\nFew **Notes** from my development process:\n- **Graphics** - First I wanted to go with pixel-art, but I quickly realized that I will not have time for it as I\u0027m not very - good at drawing it (it\u0027s something I definitely want to improve on in future). So I decided for super fast solution -\u003e MS Paint. All Sprites were drawn with it, hardest part was E.T itself as I had to combine different shapes, in different angles and sizes. I used GIMP for adding transparent layers.\n- **Code** - In my professional life I am front-end React developer so when I realized that I can just use VSCode I was super happy! I set up few things, configured some extensions and I started coding right away! I learned a lot as this was basically my first project in Unity (they made their docs really easy to read). One thing that helped me a lot was plugin iTween recommended by a friend.\n- **Audio** - This might have been my favorite part. I laughed whole time as I was creating and editing those sound effects. Good thing that I had that beer in fridge and also duck tape.\n\nThings that I would **improve or change**:\nBiggest problem was the time. There are a couple of things that I really wanted to add to the game but I just didn\u0027t have time.\n1. **Animations** for E.T - right now E.T looks super blunt and it worsens overall feeling from the game. I wanted to add expressions to his face when beer was close to his Infusion or face of guilt when he would poop himself.\n2. Another **Need** for E.T - there was a plan to add one more item iPhone with airpods. Player would have to give E.T airpods to both ears and then start song on iPhone (it would also change game sound loop) and than when E.T would have enough of listening, remove them and stop the song.\n3. Better **music** - game sound loops were the last things I worked on and it shows. I used this web app https://beepbox.co/ to create some songs but I am really not happy with outcomes. I felt like my head wanted to explode at some point.\n\nOverall I am super happy that I did this. I learned a lot, got nice experience and mainly it was **super fun**. I definitely will try next Ludum Dare! Heck, I might start working on some other game in meanwhile just because I might feel like it!",

Espcially when I realised that the tutorial that I was following only explained how to draw walls but not sprites :smile: .\n\nI\u0027m happy that I found some time to compose a theme and work on the audio even if I would\u0027ve like to create more assets (wall texture etc) and create more animations. \n\n\nI hope that you will have some fun playing my game :slight_smile: \n\n\n####  :warning: GamePlay notice :warning:\n\nUse arrow keys to move\n\nSpace bar to activate your power (you can go through walls) but mind your health bar !\n\n\n####  :tools: Tools that I used \n\n- Music : https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/ (great tool that I discovered during this LD)\n\n- Graphism : https://www.piskelapp.com/\n\n- Audio : My cell phone and https://twistedwave.com/online\n\n- RayCasting tutorial : https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/\n\n\n",

It\u0027s been a long time since we had a scientist such as yourself come visit.\n\nIn Rewilding: The Story of Wolfhead Valley you are a rewilding specialist sent to help restore the valley\u0027s natural ecosystem after decades of human disruption.\n\nFor 3 (in-game, very short) years you are going to plant forests, seed meadows, and reintroduce rabbits, deer, and wolves (make sure they all have enough food before you do, or they won\u0027t last long!)\n\nEach spring you will have the ability to add more plants and animals to the valley, then sit back and see how it develops over the rest of the year.\n\nAt the end of the 3 years, your efforts will be judged based on how much wildlife you\u0027ve managed to keep alive. Good luck!",

        "body":  "![finish1.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c256.png)\n\nHi.\n\nThis is a game about kidnapping children and feeding them to an Evil Sewer Clown. Actually, Evil Sewer Clown is kind of a long name. But I just can\u0027t think of a name that fits better...oh well. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not a problem. And I\u0027m even more sure I won\u0027t get any threatening legal letters if I don\u0027t think of any better names.\n\n![finish4.gif](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c20d.gif)\n\n\"Wait a minute, there\u0027s no clown in that gif at all!\"\n\nYes, this is true. I don\u0027t know how to draw clowns, and therefore, I was unable to put one into the game. Also, this is the first game I\u0027ve ever made, so take it easy, sheeeesh. Anyways, that gif shows most of the gameplay. Drag the children into the sewers and run away from cops. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have spoiled it all in one gif.\n\nYou know, I hear if you get to Level 100 without getting hit by any cops, there\u0027s an awesome final boss fight where you rise up against the Evil Sewer Clown.\n\nOr maybe not. Who knows? Look in the source code if you care enough. And if you don\u0027t mind going blind from awful code practices.\n\nHere\u0027s some more screenshots. Everyone likes those.\n\n![finish2.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c27b.png)\n\n![finish3.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c280.png)\n\n\n\nAnd for the brave reader who actually made it this far down the page, here\u0027s an extra special making-of screenshot. Just for you.\n\n![progress1.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c28c.png)\n\nYeah, it\u0027s not that great. That\u0027s ok, neither is this game.\n\nThanks for reading!",

When you upgrade your phone, you make more money, and your battery life is drained slower. However, your battery will decrease no matter what level phone you are at. You can recharge your battery 0-10 times, (Different battery levels allow more recharges) but once it breaks, you have to buy a new one at Ahmazoon. To make the game harder, there will be hackers that drain your battery life at an inconsistent rate. You can also go to Ahmazoon in order to buy something that makes the hackers drain less battery each time. When you buy your phone, you will receive a question. If you answer the question right, you will get extra money to help you throughout the game. Answer it  wrongâ¦ and you will have to pay the price. Finally, have fun!",

        "body":  "# The year is 2038. \n\nAfter a decade of trouble, Apple decided to finally crush the IT sector by using brute force. \nYou are Nem, the owner of the last surviving copy of the K\u0026R Bible that hasn\u0027t been snatched by Apple. Should it be lost, millions of incompetent coders will write terrible C and Apple will eventually become a monopoly.\n\nThe book, Nem. You must keep it alive to keep IT alive!!!\n\n![2b69a.gif](///raw/f90/1/z/2c480.gif)\n\n# Controls\n\nUse the **mouse** to clear Nem\u0027s path. The book is too large; she can\u0027t see what\u0027s in front of her!\n\nPat her head 3 times to restart.\n\nI recommend using a real mouse. I think it might be unbeatable with a trackpad/trackpoint.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nUsing soundfonts: \"Aegean Symphonic Orchestra\" and one of the \"20 free synth soundfonts\"\n\n# Video \n\nhttps://youtu.be/hQDsGSOfUow\n\n# Lesson learned\n\nEveryone and their grandmother use a game engine, and I don\u0027t. I didn\u0027t do my homework and didn\u0027t prepare anything aside from the previous LD game\u0027s code, so I wrote everything from almost ground zero. Therefore, even though I\u0027m happy with how it turned out, it could have been better if I hadn\u0027t spent several hours on collision.",

It\u0027s not a party unless we add more balloons! You don\u0027t have to save these balloons, but keeping them alive increases your score! Now, it can\u0027t be that easy. Parties are dangerous! Several obstacles will try to stop you from surviving, but as long as you keep your red balloon alive, all is good! Play multiple times to try and beat your high score. Good Luck!",

Hard mode is recommended for a more intense experience, but you will probably want a mouse (not a trackpad).\n\nThe game is played completely with the mouse.\n\n![titleScreen.JPG](///raw/0e6/8/z/2c369.jpg)\n![aim.JPG](///raw/0e6/8/z/2c36e.jpg)\n![wires.JPG](///raw/0e6/8/z/2c370.jpg)\n![spam.JPG](///raw/0e6/8/z/2c375.jpg)\n![react.JPG](///raw/0e6/8/z/2c376.jpg)",

In this game, you defend your campfire from the \"corruption\", glitchy ice monsters who HATE your fire.\n\n# HOW TO PLAY\n\nYou need to keep your campfire alive. Enemies will head straight for your fire from all angles, ignoring you completely. To defeat an enemy, smack it with your torch. Use your jetpack to move around the tundra quickly. If an enemy gets close to your campfire, a warning will appear on your screen to let you know.\n\nDestroying an enemy will increase your combo meter.  Keeping your combo streak going is the key to getting a high score. Occasionally, you\u0027ll need to stray far from your fire to keep your meter up. If you\u0027re in a situation where you don\u0027t think you can make it back to your fire in time to save it, you can transfer your campfire to a new location by burning a tree down, though this will clear your multiplier.\n\nHave fun, and thanks for playing!\n\n# CONTROLS\n\n- **WASD** - Movement\n- **Space** - Use jetpack\n- **Left mouse** - Swing torch\n- **Right mouse** - Burn tree, convert to campfire\n- **P** - Pause\n- **Esc** - Exit game\n- **1** - Switch between fullscreen/windowed. May be slightly glitchy!\n- **2** - Toggle screen shaders\n\n# TOOLS\n\n- **LOVE 2D** - Game engine\n- **Pico-8, bfxr, and Audacity** - Sound creation\n- **http://terrain.party** - Terrain height map\n- **https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font** - Font\n\n",

The Battery has been game created for Ludum Dare 46 with theme: Keep it alive\n\nWell, The battery is a arcade-like top-down game, when your character needs to clear the dungeon, collect batteries to keep his \"explorer\u0027s light\" up and running. He fights various monsters and collects new weapons, potions and progresses on his journey to uncover the ULTIMATE power source.\n\nControls:\nmovement - WASD\nshooting - SPACE\npicking tools - 1-5 or clicking\ninteraction - F\ndropping batteries - mouse click\nopen inventory - I or E\n\nI mean this truly was an experience. My first Ludum Dare, first game jam, first time to do anything with pixel art.\n\nI\u0027ll appreciate your opinions :)\n\nThanks, guys!\n\n![2.png](///raw/c1e/c2/z/2c314.png)\n![6.png](///raw/c1e/c2/z/2c31a.png)\n![4.png](///raw/c1e/c2/z/2c317.png)\n![5.png](///raw/c1e/c2/z/2c319.png)",

But the catch is it was going to be a struggle to keep it from splatting on the ground while it\u0027s being transported.  Mostly just a story that went along with the mechanics of the game as they progressed.  Originally I thought about someone dropping a bomb in a factory, and a machine tried to keep it from exploding.  But I couldn\u0027t do the art for an indoor factory / lab setting, and I realized I could use the martian terrain from reference images.\n\nMy wife just asked me to dedicate this to her, so sure honey, this game can be dedicated to you!  It\u0027s my first ever game jam, and if I could do it all over again I\u0027d rush to get a fully working prototype up and running before starting any polish, audio creation, sprite creation, etc.  Had a great time, I\u0027ll definitely be submitting in October as well!  Good luck everyone, I can\u0027t wait to see all of your games! :)\n\nThanks,\nJake",

Your job is to keep their interest high by engaging in conversation with them.  That should be a snap, even for someone as socially awkward as you!\n\n## Controls\n- **WASD:** Move\n- **1 through 5:** Quickly select a conversation topic\n- **Q/E or Mouse Wheel:** Cycle through conversation topics\n- **Space or Left Mouse Button:** Talk\n- **Z or Right Mouse Button:** Research\n- **Escape:** Quit\n\n![lotp_ss_02.png](///raw/93a/z/2c37d.png)\n\n## Gameplay\n- Talk to guests in order to keep their interest high.  If interest drops too low (indicated by the guest changing color), they will leave the party.\n- When talking to a guest, they will reply with a similar topic (same shape or color).  You can only keep the conversation going by replying with a similar topic as well (same shape or color, but not both).  Any other topic will confuse or anger them.  (The first topic you speak to a guest about is always a good topic.)\n- You will automatically store the topic a guest talks to you about, replacing whatever topic you told them.  (If only one guest remains, the topic will not be stored.)\n- To get new topics or replace existing ones, Research on your phone, which provides a new random topic into your current slot.  This takes a couple of seconds, so don\u0027t be on your phone too excessively!\n- If all the guests leave, the party is officially dead.  The timer will show you how long you kept the party going.  Fee; free to post your best times in the comments below!\n\n## Credits\n- All programming, graphics, music and sound were created by: Mark J. Hadley",

You\u0027ll have to give it the water it needs and defend it against dangerous ennemies !\n\nThe game is pretty straightforward and very simple, you\u0027ll have to develop the flower until it reaches lvl 5. The idea behind it was that it would become a beautiful orchid at the end.\n\n![Flower2.png](///raw/f7e/32/z/2c362.png)\n\nIf the flower has enough water you\u0027ll earn \"Flower points\" that you can spend on water, leveling up or to call the angry birds for rescue. It also gains health points if supplied with enough water. The more water it has, the more points you get. Water supply is maxed at 100, like health point and flower points are not capped\n\nSlugs will have a chance to spawn and will try to eat the flower. The chance of spawn raises with the level (very rare on level 1, not so much after). You\u0027ll need to call the angry birds to defend it. Watch out, each angry bird will only attack a limited amount of time.\n\n![call_the_police.png](///raw/f7e/32/z/2c374.png)\n\nI would have loved to add a proper soundtrack or effects for this game, especially with wind sound to add an ambiance to the game, but here is my compo for this Ludum dare 46 !\n\nDevelopped in Python, using the pygame library.",

        "body":  "INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nUse the Plant seeds button to start planting seeds. The seeds will become beans aftera certain amount of time. You can speed this time up by applying fertilizers to the seeds.\n\nOnce they become beans they can be eating by insects and you also need to water them frequently. Deploy pesticide to make the insects stay away from the crops.\n\nYou loose the game if all your crops die, or get eaten.\n\nControls: You control the entire game with the buttons at the bottom. The tractor will follow a set path, so it will be easier for you to keep the early seeds in the path alive.\n\nHINTS: I\u0027m not sure the fertilizer is worth it right now, the growth time may be a bit to short.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES:\n\nTHe WebGL builds seems to have some issues with audio, I currently have about halft the sound effects, and another person reported they had none.\nThe game is also a bit to easy I think\n\nWindows build will be added shortly.\n",

Keep going until there is no more fuel.\n\n* W A S D/ Arrow Keys = Move character\n* E = Pickup item (when prompted) and close dialog boxs.\n\nIn the top left of the screen is your fuel indicator and the top right shows your current held item\n\n![gameplay.gif](///raw/30f/71/z/2c1de.gif)\n\n# A final word\n\nThank you for playing this \u0027game\u0027. I really appreciate it and i am super proud of what i\u0027ve achieved here regardless of where i place.\n\nThis was my first ever submission to the Ludum Dare 46 Compo! I previously submitted a game to the Jam in LD42 as part of a team; but this was the first time going solo! As per the Compo rule all assets were made by myself using the following tools:\n\n* Unity for the engine\n* Aseprite to create the pixel \u0027art\u0027\n* Bosca Ceoilâ to create the music\n* Audacity (and my microphone)to create the sound effects.\n* YouTube/Stack Overflow/Google for answers to my gamedev problems.\n\nFinally i tracked what i spent time on. Here\u0027s a quick breakdown: Sleeping/Breaks (19hrs), Dev (9hrs), Graphics (7.5hrs), Sound (4hrs), Polishing (6hrs). Total (26.5hrs working).\n",

You\u0027ll receive radio communications to help you pin down which of the civilians is really an assassin.\n\n![gameplay1_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a8.gif)\n\nOnce you\u0027ve found the assassin, take your shot before they have a chance to kill the VIP!\n\n![success_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a9.gif)\n\nPlay progressively harder levels with more and more civilians but try not to shoot any innocent bystanders, they won\u0027t like that very much.\n\n**My high score is level 9, see if you can beat it!**\n\nSome tips for success (Read if you don\u0027t care to discover them yourself):\n\n* After 35 seconds the assassin can stab the VIP\n* If someone walks through the VIP past 35 seconds, they probably aren\u0027t the assassin\n* If you hear a sound and the screen shakes, the assassin tried to stab the VIP but failed. He\u0027s probably still close by!\n* After 120 seconds the assassin will aggressively seek out the VIP\n* Take a warning shot to stop the civilians for a second!\n\n**Here\u0027s a video of the game in action:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stg44OvBTqI\n\n\n\n\n",

Keep going until there is no more fuel.\n\n* W A S D/ Arrow Keys = Move character\n* E = Pickup item (when prompted) and close dialog boxs.\n\nIn the top left of the screen is your fuel indicator and the top right shows your current held item\n\n![gameplay.gif](///raw/30f/71/z/2c1de.gif)\n\n# A final word\n\nThank you for playing this \u0027game\u0027. I really appreciate it and i am super proud of what i\u0027ve achieved here regardless of where i place.\n\nThis was my first ever submission to the Ludum Dare 46 Compo! I previously submitted a game to the Jam in LD42 as part of a team; but this was the first time going solo! As per the Compo rule all assets were made by myself using the following tools:\n\n* Unity for the engine\n* Aseprite to create the pixel \u0027art\u0027\n* Bosca Ceoilâ to create the music\n* Audacity (and my microphone)to create the sound effects.\n* YouTube/Stack Overflow/Google for answers to my gamedev problems.\n\nFinally i tracked what i spent time on. Here\u0027s a quick breakdown: Sleeping/Breaks (19hrs), Dev (9hrs), Graphics (7.5hrs), Sound (4hrs), Polishing (6hrs). Total (26.5hrs working).\n",

You\u0027ll receive radio communications to help you pin down which of the civilians is really an assassin.\n\n![gameplay1_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a8.gif)\n\nOnce you\u0027ve found the assassin, take your shot before they have a chance to kill the VIP!\n\n![success_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a9.gif)\n\nPlay progressively harder levels with more and more civilians but try not to shoot any innocent bystanders, they won\u0027t like that very much.\n\n**My high score is level 9, see if you can beat it!**\n\nSome tips for success (Read if you don\u0027t care to discover them yourself):\n\n* After 35 seconds the assassin can stab the VIP\n* If someone walks through the VIP past 35 seconds, they probably aren\u0027t the assassin\n* If you hear a sound and the screen shakes, the assassin tried to stab the VIP but failed. He\u0027s probably still close by!\n* After 120 seconds the assassin will aggressively seek out the VIP\n* Take a warning shot to stop the civilians for a second!\n\n**Here\u0027s a video of the game in action:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stg44OvBTqI\n\n\n\n\n",

Just try not to think too much of the old tales about how the cave is haunted by the deceased spelunkers.\n\n[ Objective ]\nYour torch expires but you need to go as far as you can before the flame dies, your best options are:\n1. Grab the flames that appear in the cave. \n2. Fight the ghosts to slow down your flame expiration.\n\n[ Controls ]\n\nMovement: WASD / Arrows\nPause = Escape\n\n[ Ghost ]\n\nEach ghost have hit points (yellow squares) but they have a flame cost (yellow number), is it worthy? well check how many seconds will you gain (blue number).\n\nHit them by sharing your fears and sharing the same tile has many times as hits are necessary.\n\n\n[ Finally ]\n\nSadly I couldn\u0027t add audio in time.\nHave fun and thank you for your time! \n",

If you run out of fuel it\u0027s game over for you, buddy. You can create more fuel in addition to numerous buildings and upgrades by using the number keys while close to the fire. You get the resources needed for this by walking up to trees (and later on rocks) and swinging your axe into them. I\u0027ll leave it up to you to discover what all the upgrades do, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do fine.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![SkÃ¤rmbild (107).png](///raw/90b/2/z/2c1e5.png)\n\n![SkÃ¤rmbild (105).png](///raw/90b/2/z/2c1f0.png)\n\nControls: \n- W and S for forwards and backwards movement.\n- A and D to rotate your character and swing your axe.\n- Shift to sprint (when unlocked)\n- I to toggle ironworks (when unlocked, important to remember since they drink fuel like I\u0027ve been drinking tea)\n- R to restart\n- Escape to exit\n\nTools:\n- Unity\n- Krita (poorly used as you may see)\n- LMMS (also poorly used, playing in a wind orchestra for 10 years hasn\u0027t prepared me for this)\n- Audacity\n\nSince this is only my second original game ever I know it\u0027s not very good but I can\u0027t help but be proud of it anyway. Please make sure you give me plenty of harsh critique so I can convince myself I shouldn\u0027t be.",

You can speed this time up by applying fertilizers to the seeds.\n\nOnce they become beans they can be eating by insects and you also need to water them frequently. Deploy pesticide to make the insects stay away from the crops.\n\nYou loose the game if all your crops die, or get eaten.\n\nControls: You control the entire game with the buttons at the bottom. The tractor will follow a set path, so it will be easier for you to keep the early seeds in the path alive.\n\nHINTS: I\u0027m not sure the fertilizer is worth it right now, the growth time may be a bit to short.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES:\n\nTHe WebGL builds seems to have some issues with audio, I currently have about halft the sound effects, and another person reported they had none.\nThe game is also a bit to easy I think\n\nWindows build will be added shortly.\n",

It was also much quicker through development than my previous submissions, and somehow I never felt pressured for time, even after polishing! It was also nice to work with more familiar programs, and to be able to use a DAW better than Bosca for music (REAPER can be got as a free trial version, but it seemingly never expires).",

The theme was Keep it alive. You have to nourish the little sunshine with water and sunlight while defending against hordes of evil bugs! Stay alive for two minutes and win the ultimate price :)\n\nIt was a fantastic experience creating this game for the last 48 hours! I know that this game is not perfect and I know so many things to improve. Still, I would love to hear your opinion on it and recommendations to improve \"little sunshine\" enjoy playing!\n![Little Sunshine 2.PNG](///raw/016/1/z/2c087.png)",

The longer your crew are alive, the more points you get.\n\nTo steer your ship, you must place down gravity wells; these will attract your ship to allow you to turn but be careful - you will lose if you crash into them!\n\nPlanets will also allow your ship to turn however these are less predictable and you have no control over them.\n\nYou can fire your engines to escape from orbits or increase your ship\u0027s velocity but use your fuel carefully, if it runs out you will be unable to use your engines.\n\nBubbles of fuel and air can be found floating in space, these can be used to refill the respective meter.\n\nIf you run out of air, you lose as your crew suffocate.",

Can you pluck and feed them to Tulip fast enough?\n\n**Controls:**\n\nWASD or Controller - Movement\nSpace/Click/Fire - Pluck flower or feed Tulip\n\nâThere is no end to this game.  The goal is to see how long you can last before Tulip passes out from lack of nutrition.\n\n**Jam Notes**\n\nâMy goal with this Ludum Dare was to create a game my kids could have fun playing.  This game was intended to be easy to play, fun to look at and silly.

Then share what you create.\n\nX33D is a slow game where you grow strange seeds into polygonal alien growths. Each seed is unique and grows in a unique way. Each generation of your seeds is slightly mutated from the last. Take your favourite seeds and breed them together to create new seeds beyond what previously existed. Discover new seed genes, and new seed types. Keep your genes alive, but encourage them to change and flourish.\n\nPlay online: [https://x33d.taybenlor.workers.dev](https://x33d.taybenlor.workers.dev)\n\n![xeed-cover.png](///raw/c7c/c2/z/2c0f0.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-20 at 8.42.41 am.png](///raw/c7c/c2/z/2c104.png)\n\nThanks to everyone who supported me and chatted online.

You can\u0027t control him, but you see his attack and hp. They hit each other taking turns, until one dies, after that new red square comes (might be stronger!).\n\nPlayer\u0027s objective is to collect tetris shapes.\nShapes have a chance to drop on enemies hit and when enemy dies 3 shapes are always dropped. You have to catch them all!\n\nShapes can be placed in one of 3 fields (or thrown away).\n\n**Blue left field**\n\nAny full horizontal lines will dissapear and player will be healed by 1 for each block\n\n**Red right field**\n\nPlayers attack gets charged, increasing damage on next attack (only one attack). If 25 blocks collected, damage permanently increased\n\n**Green bottom field**\n\nThis is sort of inventory field, shapes can be placed there temporarly and taken when needed, unlike other fields where shapes are put permanently\n\n\n\nHope you like it!\n\np.s. this is my first entry where I tried to make my own music, didn\u0027t have much time for that unfortunately. The track was created DAWless with Korg Volca Keys, Korg Volca Bass, Korg Volca Beats, sequenced by Beatstep pro and Keystep.",

The battle will keep getting more intense until one side wins, at which point its game over. Keep them alive as long as possible!\n\nControls:\nWASD/Arrow keys: Move\nSpace: Activate Aura (Heal humans and knock away objects)\n\nTips:\n- Soldiers don\u0027t have strong allegiances, knocking them to the other side will cause them to change sides! Use this to balance power if one side is on their last legs.\n- Spears become harmless after touching the ground.\n- My high score is 129 seconds! Can you do better?\n\nThis game was made for Ludum dare 46, which had the theme \u0027Keep it alive\u0027",

There are just some strange circles into a playground bound via rules.\n\nSo I ask you to use your **IMAGINATION** a bit. \n\n...2020. Self-isolation and loneliness. We need to stay home to protect our friends and families, we aren\u0027t? But one `*****` always needs to move somewhere. It\u0027s a hamster. :hamster: When it stops, it dies. When it moves, it lives. Only other blue medical orderly hamsters can stop this crazy hamster using a special sleeping pill. You know these pills don\u0027t work properly. They are killing every hamster around. \n\nSo I offer to play hamster and KEEP IT ALIVE as longer as you can. Let\u0027s break the serious rules only in the games. Are you agreed?\n\nI hope you\u0027ll enjoy moving ~~an orange circle~~ the hamster and avoiding these nasty white ~~bullets~~ pills.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GU4052eCvGM\n",

No fancy controls.\n\nIt\u0027s been developed over two days for Ludum Dare 46\u0027s compo. I\u0027ve made everything from scratch except the font (Bahnschrift) using Unity, C#, Blender, sfxr, Bosca Ceoil, Audacity and Adobe Photoshop. To create the original spacerock texture, I transformed two free texture packs available on https://3dtextures.me.â Also, everything is inspired, of course, by the original design of the Shadoks. That\u0027s why I opted-out the \"Mood\" category.\n\nThis is one of my first experiences. I started C#, Unity and Blender 8 months ago and had to learn by myself. Every piece of advice or critique will be very appreciated, but please remember I\u0027m new to it.",

Yet we all know that feeling whenever you find a sleeping baby, the urge to throw it into the air to gain points. Keeping the dream alive. The dream that maybe, just maybe, the throw will make the baby reach orbit, and it will be gone forever.\n\n![Cover.png](///raw/c41/f2/z/2bfef.png)\n\n3 Tips to become a hero:\n\n- Give the baby what it wants. \n\n- Don\u0027t hold the baby too long, we all know babies are little puke machines. \n\n- Birds are stupid and annoying and always in the way and I hate them so very very much. \n\nGood luck and please share your highscores!

Even though I had planned using some different development systems for each jams, after announcement of theme I decided to develop a hyper-casual game. I wanted to extend it to a casual but that will be on full release I think.\n\nGame is simple, you are trying to protect animals gathered at the center of the screen. There are some alien ships who want to destroy animals. Your goal is preventing aliens as long as possible while not letting animals die from hunger. I am thinking adding some powerups to give some variety to gameplay and maybe a different part to see gathered animals (this is supported in this version to but I did not finished implementation). If you can give me ideas about gameplay that will be very helpfull.\n\nI codded whole game by myself there is only free LeanTween library in addition to my codes. I developed game in Unity. At the start my goal was participating in Jam but whole game finished yesterday so I decided to run for compo. I tried to try out some different tools and styles for graphics and I am aware that neither graphics not musics are good. I don\u0027t have a sense of art I think.\n\nAnyway time to make a game for Jam this time. Enjoy Precious Animals and keep them safe as long as possible for me please.\n\n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002636.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be88.jpg) \n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002716.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be8c.jpg)",

Then, use those resources to build more and get upgrades.\n\n![ImageBar1.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be75.png)\n\n## Instructions\n* Start by building some simple roots. Roots collect water and nutrients. Nutrients are essential for building more in the future.\n* Add some branches up top. Sunlight can be used for upgrades.\n* Get upgrades! The bugs can become a problem. You don\u0027t want them hanging around.\n* Get even bigger. There is nothing stopping you. Only rule, stay alive!\n\n### Resources\nThe three resources are water, nutrient, and sun. If any three of these reach 0 your tree will start to die. Be extra careful with nutrient, it is essential to expand and it is impossible to obtain it again if you run out.\n\n### Building\nTo start building roots or branches, press the build button located on the top of the screen. Then, use your mouse to select a starting location. This location must be on the tree. Next, pick an ending location. This location will be the point the branch will grow out to. If the line is red, it can not be built. The amount of nutrient required to build is shown next to your cursor.\n\n*Note: Branches can\u0027t go down and roots can\u0027t go up. Also, they can not cross.*\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-19 at 5.25.20 PM.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be7b.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n| Input | Function |\n|---|---|\n| `W` `A` `S` `D`  `Arrows` | Move Camera |\n| `Left Mouse` |  Select |",

The sounds can be loud.\n- You\u0027ll need to play on desktop with your browser maximized as I didn\u0027t have time to figure out canvas scaling etc.\n- With more time I would have liked to work more with the music/audio side, as the sounds are fairly basic at the moment, but I ended up spending too much time on completing the game mechanics.\n- Hope you enjoy, all feedback welcome!\n\n![Screenshot 2020-04-19 at 22.26.42.png](///raw/f8e/11/z/2beb7.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2020-04-19 at 22.41.28.png](///raw/f8e/11/z/2bee8.png)",

        "body":  "In **Your Pet Alien**, your objective is to care for your pet while also keeping your family from finding it. \n\nUse your **Closet** to **hide it**, and use your **Bed** to **heal it**. Every sound that you or your pet makes attracts your mom\u0027s attention, so you must be very strategic. \n\nFurthermore, doing chores makes your mom less likely to enter your room, and you get an extra bonus if she watches you do chores. You also need to be aware of where in the house she is and how close she is to your room.\n\n*Note: nothing is inherently scary about this game, but the atmosphere may creep some people out. This was influenced by games by Scott Cawthon as well as Baldi\u0027s Basic\u0027s :)*\n\n![LD46 Gif 1.gif](///raw/f22/c/z/2bf5d.gif)",

Even though I had planned using some different development systems for each jams, after announcement of theme I decided to develop a hyper-casual game. I wanted to extend it to a casual but that will be on full release I think.\n\nGame is simple, you are trying to protect animals gathered at the center of the screen. There are some alien ships who want to destroy animals. Your goal is preventing aliens as long as possible while not letting animals die from hunger. I am thinking adding some powerups to give some variety to gameplay and maybe a different part to see gathered animals (this is supported in this version to but I did not finished implementation). If you can give me ideas about gameplay that will be very helpfull.\n\nI codded whole game by myself there is only free LeanTween library in addition to my codes. I developed game in Unity. At the start my goal was participating in Jam but whole game finished yesterday so I decided to run for compo. I tried to try out some different tools and styles for graphics and I am aware that neither graphics not musics are good. I don\u0027t have a sense of art I think.\n\nAnyway time to make a game for Jam this time. Enjoy Precious Animals and keep them safe as long as possible for me please.\n\n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002636.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be88.jpg) \n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002716.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be8c.jpg)",

Then, use those resources to build more and get upgrades.\n\n![ImageBar1.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be75.png)\n\n## Instructions\n* Start by building some simple roots. Roots collect water and nutrients. Nutrients are essential for building more in the future.\n* Add some branches up top. Sunlight can be used for upgrades.\n* Get upgrades! The bugs can become a problem. You don\u0027t want them hanging around.\n* Get even bigger. There is nothing stopping you. Only rule, stay alive!\n\n### Resources\nThe three resources are water, nutrient, and sun. If any three of these reach 0 your tree will start to die. Be extra careful with nutrient, it is essential to expand and it is impossible to obtain it again if you run out.\n\n### Building\nTo start building roots or branches, press the build button located on the top of the screen. Then, use your mouse to select a starting location. This location must be on the tree. Next, pick an ending location. This location will be the point the branch will grow out to. If the line is red, it can not be built. The amount of nutrient required to build is shown next to your cursor.\n\n*Note: Branches can\u0027t go down and roots can\u0027t go up. Also, they can not cross.*\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-19 at 5.25.20 PM.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be7b.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n| Input | Function |\n|---|---|\n| `W` `A` `S` `D`  `Arrows` | Move Camera |\n| `Left Mouse` |  Select |",

Every sound that you or your pet makes attracts your mom\u0027s attention, so you must be very strategic. \n\nFurthermore, doing chores makes your mom less likely to enter your room, and you get an extra bonus if she watches you do chores. You also need to be aware of where in the house she is and how close she is to your room.\n\n*Note: nothing is inherently scary about this game, but the atmosphere may creep some people out. This was influenced by games by Scott Cawthon as well as Baldi\u0027s Basic\u0027s :)*\n\n![LD46 Gif 1.gif](///raw/f22/c/z/2bf5d.gif)",

Collectively, they are known as the League of Earth\u0027s Worseningly Deranged Scientists. Their experiment: putting heads into jars.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations with the World\u0027s United Sanest Scientists, the key ingredient to the experiment was identified: heads in jars *without the body attached*.\n\nIs is now the even more distant future, the year 201Y.\n\nYou, wearing a kind of a jar on your head, and a creature you can only refer to as ***IT*** are the last of your kind.\n\nYou are the **JarHeads**.\n\n![shot2.png](///raw/133/z/2bfe3.png)\n\nAlso for some reason you have to avoid waves of bullets.",

In the middle of a rest cycle, Gale receives new instructions from the impossible. Could it be that humans have given new orders?\n\n======\n\nSunset Directive is a work of interactive fiction. I chose to do interactive fiction this time around because I have been working on Casementâ, an interactive engine for Twine. Sunset Directive uses Casement for inventory interactions, examination windows, and conversations. A good amount of changes happened during the jam, since this was the first time I put it to use! Several issues need to be worked out. \n\nSince Sunset Directive is choice-based interactive fiction, all you should need is your mouse or a mobile device. It should work fine on mobile (I put in extra queries for some of the windows at portrait). \n\nA note on mechanics. Casement has a system whereby you can use items that you\u0027re currently looking at (context-sensitive). Sometimes you might be asked for an inventory item, and you\u0027ll need to select it in your inventory. It doesn\u0027t come up too often, though, so I hope it isn\u0027t too confusing! \n\n======\n\nJSON for conversations was generated using the [JSON Online Editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/).

Can you keep it alive?\n\n### Technical stuff\nYou don\u0027t need an account. Details about your tree are stored locally (javascript local storage). If you reload the pag, even if a long time has passed, the tree will show the correct state (as if it was \"running\" the entire time). Actually we just apply the missing time very quickly.\n\n### For Ludum Dare Testers\nThe normal game mode takes about two years for a full grown tree. To make things simpler there are two test game mode.\n\n#### LD46 Mode\nThis is the recommended game mode for LD46 testers. A full grown tree takes about 2h and should be watered about every 15 to 30 minutes.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/LD46/\n\n#### No-Zen Mode\nFor very unpatient players there is an even faster mode. A tree takes about a minute to fully grow.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/FAST/\n",

If I did I would have spent more time working on minigames that better tied in with the spaceship theme and in-game tutorials for them. I think I managed to improve on the last jam I entered by taking some time to add sound effect which really helps the game. Overall though another fun game jam.\n\nHope you Enjoy and Thanks for playing.\n\n![Icon.PNG](///raw/ad8/d1/z/2bde1.png) \n\nHow To Play:\n\nClick on the consoles and play the minigame to fix them as the timers run out.\n\nMinigame 1 : \n\nThe ships self destruct sequence has activated, enter the code shown alphabetically to reset the timer.\n\nMinigame 2: \n\nA distant object is on a collision course, lock the horizontal and vertical aiming bars onto the target and destroy it before its too late.\n\nMinigame 3:\n\nThe Ships navigation system is failing, adjust the navigation screen until a complete image is shown, before you fly into a sun.\n\nTools Used:\n- Unity 2019.3.10f1\n- BFXR 1.5.1\n- GIMP 2.10.18",

Tiredness mixed with headache, therefore this game is obvisouly not finished, there is no sound and the polishing is not done. I hope you\u0027ll still have fun playing it. Thanks for checking it out.\n\n\nThe idea of the game was, that you have to sacrifice small minions to keep the monster alive. Sadly there is no goal or threat, just have fun with it though!\n\n![imageA.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc05.jpg)\n\n![imageB.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc06.jpg)![cover.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc07.jpg)",

        "body":  "![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 21-07-32.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2bbfb.png)\n*adventure awaits!*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 11-33-25.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b951.png)\n*picking castles, taking names*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 19-17-26.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b955.png)\n*the tunnels*\n\n### Intro\n\n**Late Medieval Network Engineer** is a game where you play a Network Engineer in the Late Middle Ages, responsible for keeping the connections between a group of castles alive while the King is away. \n\nTo do this, you travel through the tunnels between castles, dealing with technically correct monsters and fearsome HTTP status codes, or possibly the other way around. \n\n### Instructions\n\nControls: Pointer / mouse, but you\u0027ll probably need to be on a laptop (or tablet) to see the whole screen. There are instruction modals in the game, but just in case: \n\nGameplay is split into two phases. In the overworld, you must choose a castle to travel to from your current castle (which will have a blue marker around it). Once you\u0027ve chosen a castle, a red marker will appear underneath it. You can then travel by clicking the \"travel\" button in the left-hand pane. \n\nTravelling takes 1 day. You have to survive for 14 days. \n\nWhile travelling, you enter the other phase of the game. You are underground and must choose a route through a sequence of cards which will affect your status and the status of the tunnel you\u0027re in. You choose from the top row of cards, again using the mouse. Depending on your last choice of card, between 2 and 3 of this top row will be selectable. Cards not adjacent to your previous position will not be selectable. \n\nThe goal overall is to keep the network of tunnels healthy and also not die yourself. At the end of every turn, the network will suffer random damage which it is your job to repair.\n\n### Theme \n\nI went with this design because the theme reminded me of the [keep-alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) HTTP header, so I wanted to create something that was kind of HTTP but not really. In this game, you are keeping a network alive. \n\n### Details\n\nThis game was made using [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and my own tool for procedurally making sprites, [pixel-factory](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/). \n\nI like pixel-factory because it lets me keep writing JavaScript all the way through the jam without breaking flow and changing to another tool. You can see an example [here](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/#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) -- this is the worm card used in-game.\n\nI\u0027m pretty happy with the results (it\u0027s the first jam I\u0027ve used it for). Generally I think sprites went well with a couple of notable exceptions (health bars in the tunnels, probably a few others). \n\nI didn\u0027t get around to audio and wish I had now -- next jam I need to write less code and use more tools! \"amount of source code produced\" and \"how fun the game is\" are pretty much completely unrelated :smile: \n\nThanks for playing and reading, I appreciate it! \n",

You will select a spirit and then utilize it in a Pokemonesque series of battles until you either fail to **keep it alive** or you triumph over the evil Demon Prince who threatens to destroy the land. Your journey will take you see many strange foes. Will you fight the legendary Ice Lobster or the ancient Lava Golem the choice is your with this games branching level select. Also this game features an option menu on the title screen which is always nice.\n\n\n**Instruction**: While the game does feature in game instructions on the main menu as well as in the description of the various pages the HTML5 version is on I will restate what is said there here for the sake of those who need it.\n\nThis game is controlled entirely by the mouse.\nAfter selecting your spirit you will be taken to a map to select one of the highlighted letters this will start your journey.\nIn battle you have four option\n - Attack which deals damage to the enemy and expends all your boost\n - Defend which reduced the damage you take and expends all your boost\n - Boost which multiples either your next attack or defense by how many boost you have stored.\n - Meditate which calms your mind and heals your spirit for a quarter of its current health;\n\n**Mac and Linux Support** as this game was made in unity I went ahead and built for both Mac and Linux feel free to download them but I lack a machine to test these builds on so I would expect that there are probably some bugs in these versions that I am completely unaware of sorry if this makes the game unplayable for you Mac and Linux users.",

Each person has a 3x3 pattern that they want to hear. If you click on the buttons to light them and match a player\u0027s preference, they\u0027re jump around in excitement. At the end of the round (30 seconds), you earn cash based on the ALIVE-o-METER results. Use cash to buy equipment (fog, confetti, fireworks) for even more energetic concerts.\n\n## Development summary\n\n* Engine: Godot\n* Art: Inkscape, Gimp\n* Music: sfxr, [SongMaker](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/)\n* Font: Google Fonts",

After you\u0027re plane has crashed in the middle of the Ocean, your only means of survival is a fishing rod. From a nearby rock, you must sit and fish to pass the time and to keep yourself alive. Surprisingly, fighting for your life can actually be pretty chill. \n\nThe game has 2 game modes to choose from:\n\n\n**Survival: **\nWith a timer counting down to your demise, you must catch fish to gain more time. Each fish adds a varying amount of time, small fish offer 5 seconds, medium sized fish offer 10 and large fish awarding a whopping 20 additional seconds of sweet sweet life. \n\n\n**Peaceful: **\nIt\u0027s just fishing, but without the shoe horned timer mechanics that I added to match the theme some what. Just relax and catch some fish. \n\n**How to play:**\nLeft click to cast your line, left click to reel it back in. \nWhen a fish is on the hook, smash left click repeatedly to reel it in. Larger fish require more clicks and will stay on the line for less time. Pull up with the mouse to reduce the number of clicks needed. \n\nYou can press \u0027R\u0027 to restart at any time and \u0027ESC\u0027 to exit to the main menu. ",

Sadly, they always find the electric sockets, dangerous kitchen tools and furnitures, and... well... and everything that is not for them.\n\nBe a better dad in real life than in this game.\n\n## Controls / Hints\n\n- Move Dad: WASD\n- Grab / Drop Child: SPACE\n\n### Tips / Points / Notes\n\nGrab and put away them from dangerous things. Keep in mind, while you\u0027re holding any of them, the points will not increase.\n\n- **Any changes will be mentioned in the Change Log.**\n- **I could only test on OSX and in browser.**\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot 2020-04-19 at 22.29.38.png](///raw/44d/71/z/2bc88.png)\n\n## About the Author and the Game\n\nI\u0027m mudlee, father of one and a hobbist game dev. This is my 5th jam, but the first LD.\n\nIn the beginning I started a completely different game in Twine, but after a half a day I threw all of my plans into trash and started over. Hence, my time was way less as I expected.\nOriginally I planned that the dad has to cook, clean and to do other housekeeping activity, but I had no more time for such extras.\n",

So yeah, keep some of them alive too, just a small tips.\n\nThere\u0027s also a multi mode where you have to be selfish to get your own fire alive, but have to steal things and maybe try to bother a bit your opponent, last fire on fire win.\n\nAbout the author:\nI\u0027m fairly new to game dev (2 months) and this is obviously my first game jam, and this is litteraly an old dream becoming true. I learned a lot during these two last days, and i had a lot of fun coding this, so, i\u0027ll hope you will have fun too trying this out :)",

I haven\u0027t even written a single line of code in that time, but it was a nice feeling to be back. Surprisingly, the whole development cycle went very smoothly. Scope was exact and achievable in the given timeframe, which was very unusual for me just a few years ago. It also has a narrative, which was impossible to fit in before (a feat of which I am very proud). I will attempt to fix any crashes on launch or game-breaking bugs even after release, but I will leave the original version available at all times. You can see any of the changes made here or on my github in the following weeks. I will also be making a full developer commentary and timelapse of the development, which I will embed here when available. I look forward to hearing what you think of my game.\n\n\n***19 April, 2020 - 23:19***\n\nThe first wave of feedback was mostly how easy it is to cheese the game by spamming bullets off-screen and killing everything. There is code in place to despawn bullets at a certain range, but it seems that it wasn\u0027t enough. I implore you to try going through the game without spamming the fire button. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience. This will eventually will be fixed in the post-compo version. Thanks for understanding.",

Thats the base rule to keep the game over away!\n\n## FAQ\n\n### It is lagging?\n\nYes i found out too late p5js has a lot of performance issues for the rendering in e.g. Firefox. Please **use chrome**.\n\n### Out of cash game over!?\n\nCheck out the cash history after your loss. Upgrades and low population are very exspensive. You have daily costs which you have to pay every 3 seconds. \n\n### What tools did you use\n\nSublime Text, Aseprite, p5js\n\n## Actions\n\n### Vitamin C\n\n![apple-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9aa.png)\n\nVitamin C will help your humans to stay longer alive. If you give them enough the chance to get infected will be lower.\n\n### Vaccinate\n\n![vaccine-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9b5.png)\n\nYour humans will be immune for 10 seconds after vaccination.\n\n### Water Storms\n\n![flooding-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9fb.png)\n\nNo Casino, no fun! Use this action carefully! It has hidden costs and it can rescue you in bad situations, make your total population strong for short periods or cause the worst infection you have ever seen.\n\n### Masks\n\n![human-mask-frame-04.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9bd.png)\n\nMasks will make your humans immun for one possible upcoming infection.\n\n### Money\n\n![inflation-5.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c6.png)\n\nMoney is important to keep live here. Print so much you can!!!\n\n### Trucks\n\n![truck-1.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c9.png)\n\nThe game will get harder the longer you survive. With the trucks it is possible to reduce the mortality. But be careful, this action has hidden costs.\n\n### Breed\n\n![birth-3.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9ce.png)\n\nNo humans, no economy. Breed as much as possible. 100 population is max. Low population will increase the daily costs. So keep the population up.\n\n### Execute sick\n\n![execute-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9d8.png)\n\nYou have trouble with infections? Just shoot them. A dead human can not infect others. Fast and effective!\n",

You need to help this orb to complete the mission.\n\nI always wanted to participate in a Ludum Dare jam. Finally I had time to do so. I hope everyone likes this game. Obviously because of the time frame, this game is really simple in terms of gameplay.\n\nThis is actually part of the compo event, so everything in this game was made by me including art, music and sound effects. Also the source code to the unity project is available below.\n\nBecause we are still in this covid-19 situation, I wish the best for everyone here. Be strong and stay safe.\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba90.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba91.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba94.png)",

I had been programming for few years already but still was stuck with Visual Basic (well at least not QBasic anymore). My friend was also just getting into programming and together we hacked up this very simple game in few hours and most likely spent way more hours playing it and competing for high scores. The game was very crude but somehow weirdly fun and addictive. It came to my mind and I wanted to try to see if I could capture that magic again. The game ended up not being very close the the original mechanically but the same essence is still there.\n\n**Flock for Feast** is an arcade style single screen score-attack game where you just try to stay alive as long as possible and rack up major points. You\u0027re in control of a flock of birds that are preyed upon by a vicious monster.\n\n---\n\n### ð®ð¹ï¸ [Download or play online on itch.io](https://anttihaavikko.itch.io/flock-for-feast) ð¹ï¸ð®\n\n---\n\n![fff-cover-v2.gif](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99b.gif)\n\n---\n\n### ð ï¸ Tools used\n- Unity 2019\n- Adobe Illustrator\n- Bfxr\n- Garage Band\n\n---\n\n### ðï¸ Gameplay video\n[Gameplay video](https://youtu.be/RB8JqLaN7dQ)\n\n### ð¥ Dev timelapse\n[Dev timelapse](https://youtu.be/DmwvkJ3IMrc)\n\n---\n\n### ð¥ï¸ Screenshots\n![a.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99d.jpg) \n\n![c.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99e.jpg) \n\n![d.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a0.jpg)\n\n![e.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a5.jpg) \n\n![f.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a6.jpg)\n",

This might sound easy at first, but it is not - and to be honest, I haven\u0027t done any programming for years (and didn\u0027t participate since LD17) so was a bit rusty to say the least.\n\nThe results; a simulator with questionable graphics, questionable sound, questionable game mechanics - but hey! - That is the results of my priorities in life!\n\nThanks for showing interest :)\n// Sune\n\n--\n\nThe GAME!\n\nThe concept is simple (and displayed on the beautiful non-virus intro page): balance the important measurable parameters in your life (the top 5 bars) by working with what you can spend your time on (the left 7 bars) - and hey!!!! you!!! - don\u0027t cheat looking up my scoring matrix and stuff in the source code!\n\nThe activities on the left helps you either increase or decrease the bars on the top.\n\nYou prioritize morning, midday, afternoon, evening and night (the five squares on the left). You can drag the squares to prioritize what you want to spend your time on with the consequences that follow.\n\nOnce in a while, like in any interesting life, events do happen! - When an event happens you have to deal with it - whether you want it or not - your life simulation cannot continue until then.\n\nThe game gets increasingly harder (basically since you have more plants to care for) so try to see how many days you can survive!\n\nGood luck.\n\n--\n\nThe source code is on GitHub and the game is based on Phaser.io and javascript.",

Word came to the throne of a bastard son, who shall rename unnamed from this day forth. The King\u0027s brother shall usurp the throne and has declared he will reign with iron hand. If the King\u0027s son, rightful heir to the throne, does not reach the castle alive, this shall be seen as a decree in which the prince relinquishes his right and bloodline...\n\nHis mother, the Lady, has instructed you to move the Prince to the throne, avoiding the Royal guards who have been instructed to stop you.\n\nMove at night... \nMove bravely, but most of all\n...\n\n\n\nKEEP THE PRINCE ALIVE...\n\n****GAMEPLAY****\n\nRun from one safehouse to the next, defeating all royal guards that are trying to take the baby prince. Be careful, once you drop the baby you will not have much time to pick him back up... All guards need to be defeated in order to enter the next safe house.\n\n\n****CONTROLS****\n\nThe control scheme for Long Live The King is extremely simple. You press [F] to wield your staff, use the arrow keys to run around and press the [DOWN] key to pick up the baby in case it was dropped.\n\nLong Live The King is an endless beat em up game developed during Ludum Dare 46, as a Compo submission. This entails that all assets (including audio) and codebase were developed within a timespan of 48 hours.",

        "body":  "__Covid Conundrum__ is a \"civil policy simulator\" that lets users experiment with the health and economic effects of various policies in a fictional county. Your county has 10,000 citizens and it\u0027s your job to keep them going in the best way you see fit.\n\nAll 10,000 citizens are modeled as individual entities. Some work and live in the same town. Others live in one town and work in another. Some don\u0027t work at all.\n\nAs in reality, you don\u0027t know who is carrying the virus--only who has been tested positive. If a town appears stable, there is still a risk in opening it up. On the other hand, prolonged restrictions may make your economy unrecoverable.\n\nYour county hospital has a capacity of 25 patients. Exceeding this amount will dramatically increase the mortality rate.\n\nThe simulation runs for 120 days--from 1 March 2020 to 29 June 2020. It begins in the paused state, and speed can be controlled via the buttons on the lower-left. When all 120 days have been simulated, the option to reset will appear.\n\n__Model Limitations__. The model is \"tuned\" to mimic real-world numbers in rural North Carolina, USA. There are some notable limitations, though. In particular, this model does not take into account traffic in and out of the county beyond a simple \"mutation rate\".\n\nOf course, the project is open source--so you can always modify the model parameters if you feel they\u0027re wrong. The files Simulation.hx, Person.hx, and City.hx contain the simulation parameters. The project was made in Stencyl. You\u0027ll need that, and the \"Text Utils\" extension to recompile the simulation.",

Anyways I didn\u0027t add the story properly but the aim of the game is for Henry and Alan to become super close friends, if they dont interact they lose their connection and well, you lose (Don\u0027t let their connection Die woAh). You play as Henry and you have to jump around the platforms to reach Alan. In the spirit of the Jam I\u0027ll be uploading this barebones thing but Ill probably update it as a personal project sometime in the future.As a disclaimer you only lose if youre below 0 points and you only lose points if you fail to get Alan within the time limit, no theres no pause screen so either be in for the ride or alt f4 your way out.\n\nIn case you\u0027re lost the controls are purely ASWD/Up-Down-Left-Right (moving left/right and jumping only)\n\nIts super basic and beginnery but I\u0027m really proud of it, finished it right before my mom could rant about my curfew (finished at 1:30am ph) lmao. Not gonna win any awards but ngl saying you finished an entire game in 1 day is great for resumes. Enjoy it yalls.\n\nP.S. about the music, don\u0027t record with your phone. You think it sounds ok, it isn\u0027t. And yes judge everything on here I know im updating it in the future but as a personal project, this is my full submission.\n\n",

To pass the levels, small plans of when and where to go are needed.\n\nI didn\u0027t make the levels quiet hard. And the puzzles are not that serious (might be better if the time wasn\u0027t limited to 48 hrs). That means, if you play platformer really well you might finish the level just before the flame dies out without thinking about the strategy.\n\nIt would be better if there was more time. At least this game is able to show that the combination of lightning system and keeping alive can make action game more \"puzzle\" and puzzle game more \"action\".\n\nBtw I made sooooooo many versions of background music to fit the atmosphere. At last I decided to use simple chords loops and make all the sound effects with sounds of instrument rather than record more realistic ones. Well the result is quiet interesting XD\n\n\n![6.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c9.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c4.png)\n\n![7.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c8.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c2.png)\n",

Time to get to work...\n\nHow to play: The game is over after 20 rounds or if you have 5 police tokens. You will need to buy cards from your hand and place them on the buildings. End turn to activate the cards effects and get a new hand.\n\nSome cards only activate when other cards are in the same building. For example: You need a keeper, tiger and a customer together in a building to earn money of the customer.\n\nPlay multiple times and find all synergies and combinations.",

It\u0027s a little more down-tempo than those refs might let on, though.\n\nWanted to make something that could be a decently meaty challenge as a player - the kind of game you pick up, learn, master and move on, but on a micro-scale. Dipped my toes into really basic procedural music for the first time, hopefully creating an emotional arc that\u0027ll make it a little more rewarding for y\u0027all to keep trying and make it through to the game\u0027s finish line!\n\n![ezgif.com-video-to-gif (4).gif](///raw/96a/6/z/2b9b6.gif)",

So make sure to obliterate those pesky enemies. You can control your character using W/A/S/D, aim using the mouse and fire pressing space (hold for more powah). \n\n*If you run this on an integrated card (Intel) there is a 50/50 chace of it rendering correctly. I don\u0027t have a fix for this sadly. If possible, share the \"log.txt\" with me so I can investigate after the jam.*\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZPdDungvk58\n\nFor those interested, I made the game using Waffle2D a simple rendering framework I made for the jam: https://github.com/piluve/Waffle2D\n",

Play risky to earn big.\n\nWhat awaits you at the bottom of the cave?

You\u0027ll help \"Francky\" to keep pace on the music, while other dancers, jealous of his performance, wil try to disturb him. And so, you\u0027ll need your keyboard and to warm up your fingers , be careful, it\u0027s going to swing!!! There\u0027s a little Tuto in Game with images to help understanding the game\u0027s progress, which is not very complicated. Enough chatting, it\u0027s up to you, let\u0027s play !!! \nKiss From France :p ![Img_01.jpg](///raw/158/e1/z/2b997.jpg)",

If someone could tell me I\u0027d like to know!\n\n## Game Description\n\nIn a future where humanity has drained nearly all of it\u0027s natural resources, a group of oddly\narmed environmentalists have found the last tree on the plant. \n\nApparently they\u0027re somehow still able to receive nearly endless shipments of low-tech turrets.\nIn their infinite wisdom, they decide to make a last stand to preserve the last piece of green\nin a sea of gray and dirt...\n\n_**How long can you last?**_\n\n## Controls\n\nThe menus in the game are primarily controlled by arrow keys unless\nexplicitly stated.\n\nThe only mouse interaction is used to place and remove units.\n\n- Tab : In-game will show you the order and amount of enemies that will come.\n- Escape : opens menu or quits game.\n- M : can mute the \"music\"",

        "body":  "After some centuries, God has decided the world should be cleared of anything untrue. To decide what will be Kept Alive (hint hint), God has tasked an angel to go to the world and record everything true in the form of first order logic statements.\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/928/z/2b804.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/928/z/2b805.png)\n\nThis is an educational game for first order logic. Concepts introduced include predicates, sets, and quantifiers. By introducing concepts one at a time in an interactive setting and letting related concepts build on itself, I hope that players will become more comfortable working with these concepts. I was probably a bit sloppy with some notation (for example, the Wikipedia page didnât have examples using sets, so including them might really be an extension of first-order logic or something like that). If you really know this stuff and notice a huge mistake, please correct me.\n",

Unfortunately your new pet seems to have no regard to safety at all and would likely run into the dungeon no weapons, no protection and most importantly no plan!\n![LD 46 1.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89c.png)\nTo make sure your new friend doesn\u0027t die immediately there has been a shop stationed outside the dungeon with all the essentials like: Broad swords, potions and of course pizza!\n![LD 46 4.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89e.png)\nNow for only 8 gold!\nWhere was I oh yes... If you don\u0027t have any money don\u0027t fret the shop has a very lenient policy on selling Items. They\u0027ll buy anything including that bit of slime you carry in your bag for no reason. \n![LD 46 2.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b8a0.png)\nIf you need to get Items just go through the dungeon and kill some of the monsters that lurk there. Although I do need to warn you that improper extraction time (flee at the right time, I like sounding smart) may end up in a swift and unjust death for your friend.\n![LD 46 3.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89f.png)\nUnfortunately your pet doesn\u0027t like running away and will sometimes ignore your cry\u0027s to flee and keep fighting in these situations we advise a dose of steak to keep your pet happy. Happiness does not only keep your pet from dying after IGNORING YOU FOR THE FIFTH TIME!!!! sorry got a bit carried away. An increase in happiness will cause your pet to be more effective during battles.\n\nThank you for reading this explanation on how your pet is going to di... I mean thank you for playing this game I hope you have fun. Tip: When you enter the dungeon your pet gets happier so fleeing isn\u0027t that bad, most of the time.",

You have a limited time to do so, and each item brought to the heart gives you more time.\n\nThe game challenges you with several puzzle-like rooms, where you have to manage the little time you have to collect the items in the right order.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Compo format, all the game and the assets were made by me, during the first 48 hours of the jam.\n\n## How do you play it?\n\nThe way you want. The game is compatible with WASD, Arrow keys and gamepads. Simply move the character like in any other game! You can pick up the items by walking on them and give them to the heart by colliding with it.\n\n## Thank you!\n\nYes, thank you for reading that page and potentially playing the game! :slight_smile: It is my first combo submission, so Iâm very happy if youâre interested in it! Comment with feedbacks and your own game so I can play it too! :wink:\n\nYou can follow me on:\n\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sticmac_JV\n* YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsPW9iLnrDY9XiUHV_P56Aw\n* Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sticmac/\n* Itch.io: https://sticmac.itch.io/",

        "body":  "It\u0027s a game about managing a band and \"keeping it alive\". But please read the description, what follows is an early little post-mortem of the game.\n\nSo. This is an unusual one.\n\nFor the first time in my Ludum Dare history (6 games + 1MiniLD + 1 warmup) have I failed to complete a game. The result is not very playable and there is no win nor lose conditions and I do not wish to continue to improve it. There are still bugs and the balancing is wildly inconsistent. \n\nI am obviously disappointed in the result but glad of the lesson learned (and I kinda like the Power Metal song name generator) : start small and expand on it. Do not waste time on big stuff and try to check if it is worth it and feasible  before starting to develop it. I spent less times on entries that are way better than this.\n\nI wasted a whole day on the map navigation and trying to add cities to it. In the end the map is useless and there are no cities on it because I approached the problem too naively and it would have required hours of work to place all the cities, for something that wasn\u0027t even needed by the gameplay.\n\nI still want to post the result because there is stuff to show. I barely finished the main gameplay loop with horrendous code during the last hours and now i don\u0027t want to ever place my eyes on it.\nBut I am not ashamed of it. I\u0027m sure it happens everytime to a lot of participants of the Ludum Dare. It\u0027s just part of the risk and I will continue to take part and try to make a more pleasant game next time. I hope all of you who reads this are proud of your creation and hope you get nice reviews. See you on the next jam and rate this entry as harshly as it should be ;)\n\nI have opted out of graphics because the only graphics are the ones in the UI lib and I didn\u0027t draw the world map myself obviously, just modified it to make it \"my own\".\n\n",

Click on the dirt to begin watering the plant. Space-bar focuses back on the whole room.\n\nCheck out the [itch.io page](https://quixoticdicker.itch.io/grove) for a web playable version.\n\nThe engine is Unity. Blender for modeling. Gimp for doing some textures. Combination of Adobe Audition and Audacity for audio editing. Garage Band for music.\n\nThis is just the first build, so hopefully I will get a few more things in there.\n\nI want to thank [savannah.smackdown](https://www.instagram.com/savannah.smackdown/) for some help with the audio.",

        "body":  "**Keep Your Faith Alive** - is my entry for the 46th LudumDare contest. I created (again) a clever puzzle game with cubes. I am proud of what I did, and especially about code because this project does\u0027nt use any collider, raycast, rigidbody or light. All aesthetic and levels are created procedurally. Finally I have a good draw calls value - more or less 20.\n\n\nThe main gameplay is easy to understand but really hard to master. At start, you move a single cube (a monk) using arrow keys so as to reach a star on ground, keeping your unique eye upwards so as to pray some divinity. So you have some epiphany - an illumination and you nourish your faith. After first levels, things are more complicated...\n\n\nMy game has been posted as a **jam** project because as aesthetic I use a shader which I coded a few weeks ago and some useful scripts. Have fun playing. Rate my project and I will rate yours. I wish you the best. Stay At Home :)\n\n**I cannot work more time on this project as I want because I have to work now, delivering thousands surgical masks in Luxembourg door to door. Thanks Covid19 :)**\n\n![Faith01.png](///raw/991/z/2bf86.png)",

Change game\u0027s name half way through! Change the genre half way through! Add features!\n- Buy new stuff in the Asset Store for real fake money! \n- Manage your game! Balance your features and progress against the focus (or, well, boredom) of your team;\n- Hire new people! Fire new people! Their destiny is in your hands! Your destiny is in the hands of the random number generator!\n- Jokes! Not even sorry for most them!\n- Lack of tutorial! An exciting opportunity to venture into the unknown or a cut corner to get the submission out on time? We both know which one it is, but why don\u0027t we pretend it\u0027s fun!\nIt logs your progress! Relieve the fun memories of the past couple of minutes at the very end of your game.\n\nHow To Play:\n\nSo, about that lack of the tutorial.  \n\nThe main goal of the game is to get your game to the finish line. To do that, you must fill all 4 bars (Game Design, Programming, Art and Sound (last one is certainly ironic considering this game\u0027s soundscape)). Each developer you take on the team add points to the bars every couple of seconds (that\u0027s Delay stat). You can review each dev\u0027s stats on the Team screen.\n\nHow do you hire new people then? From the same Team screen. Just pick the devs you like from the list of available people and click them. This list refreshes every once in a while.\n\nNow, making indie games for free for prolonged periods of time leads to the loss of focus and Boredom. That\u0027s the grey bar on top of the bars. Every time it fills -- a developer you hired leaves the project. If you don\u0027t have any more people on the team and you yourself get bored -- that\u0027s Game Over.\n\nSo, how do you prevent it? Change the project over at the Project screen, of course. Add new features, change name, genre or theme -- go nuts. But, obviously, overhauling the project half way through comes at a great (well, -ish) cost. You lose some of the points you already accumulated.\n\nSome people on your team come with free money. Go over to the Store and spend it on assets to boost your bars and alleviate some boredom.\n\nAs your project comes to an end (successfully or not) you will be shown a log of story of your game\u0027s development. \n\nNow that I\u0027m writing this, I realize that you kinda have to Alt+F4 out of the game to start over, but it\u0027s a bit late to change things, huh.",

Plz forgive. ty)\n\nAlso I ran out of snacks, so if I could get an F in the chat from the bois, I\u0027ll be happy. \n\nControls: just push buttons lol you\u0027ll figure it out. Also, like all our games, we have a lil cheat going on. Look on the bottom if you wanna ruin the game.\n\n(some) Artwork: @Rexxe\n\nArtwork, Code, and pretty much everything else: @Nurf\n\nMusic is brought to you by Nurf Records (AKA @Nurf made it, so don\u0027t come and tell us to disable rating for music, he spent very much time on it (like 15 minutes and then removed the vocals, so at least like 17 minutes). You can find it on SoundCloud if you are into that stuff, and it will probably be released on Spotify, because he does that kind of thing.\n\n@YuKey0 freaking ditched me this time, so if you were expecting to see her stuff, then I\u0027m sorry. @Rexxe did her best. (I think). \n\nSeriously, this is good game. We worked very hard on this. \n\nty.\n\n\nAlso, Android version will be put up on Google Play, but for obvious reasons, it won\u0027t be used as the submission, cos google be slow like that.\n\nPermissions required on Android: ![permissions.PNG](///raw/721/4/z/2b7b7.png)\n\n\n\nCTRL key.

And take as much photos as you can of the wild animals! :smile: \n\n#### Personal note\nThis is my first Ludum Dare game! I learned lots of things during the development and it has motivated me a lot!! I developed this game using my own game engine [Skygine](https://github.com/AsierFox/Skygine) done in SDL2 and I\u0027m so proud of it :)\nI hope that with the experience achived here I can improve my own skills of developmnet and design!! Thank you so much for playing my game and see you in the next LD!! :wink: ",

This is my first Ludum entry that i\u0027ve actually finished, so I hope you will all enjoy it for at least a little while. I used Construct for the game engine, Photoshop for all graphics (except Ludum Dare logo), and audacity for all the sounds ( except main music ). \n\nPet Life, a home for your animals. Buy different types of animals, and feed them and play with them to keep them alive and happy!  The more updated it gets, the more options there are for and endless gaming pet experience. I was hoping to add more features, such as multiple animals, toys and stuff in the shop. But alas, I made what I made with the time I had possible. I hope you all enjoy! \n\nThe full source code is available if you wish to learn from this or build onto it!\n\nThe absolutely ONLY two things I did not make myself during this 48 hours, was the LUDUM DARE logo included on the Cover Image and Main Menu of the game! As well as the main game music, this was made by SirJoan620 during Ludum Dare for Ludum Dare entries. All visuals, code, and all the other audio was done by me during Ludum Dare!",

You have to personally choose which crops to grow and sell to merchants in exchange for gold coins to save the farm. Some crops have short planting time and low yield, and some grow for a long time with high yields. Water and fertilizer in the soil decrease over time, and you need gold coins in exchange for water and fertilizer. How to bring the farm back to life, it\u0027s all about your choices. By the way, the crop will wither if you don\u0027t log on to the game for a long time.\n### About Us\nThis is the first time my friend tww and I have participated in LD together. The size of the game is small. There was no way out. There were only two of us, and neither of us could do art. By the way it\u0027s a very exciting 72-hour way to make a game, It makes us less likely to procrastinate. We will continue to do more fun games in the future, we hope you support a lot. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n### + ä¸­æ +\n### å\u0085³äºæ¸¸æ\nååºå·²ç»æ¿ä¸´ç ´äº§ï¼ä½ éè¦äº²èªå»éæ©ç§æ¤åªç§ä½ç©åç»åäººæ¢åéå¸æ¯æååºï¼æçä½ç©ç§æ¤æ¶é´ç­ï¼æ¶çä½ï¼æçæ¶é´é¿ï¼æ¶çé«ï¼åå£¤ä¸­çæ°´ååè¥æä¼éçæ¶é´åå°èåå°ï¼ä½ éè¦ç¨éå¸å»æ¢åæ°´ååè¥æï¼æä¹æ ·è®©ååºèµ·æ­»åçï¼ä¸åé½é ä½ çéæ©ï¼é¡ºä¾¿è¯´ä¸å¥ï¼é¿æ¶é´ä¸ç»æ¸¸æçè¯ä½ç©ä¼æ¯èç\n### å\u0085³äºæä»¬\nè¿æ¯æåææåtwwé¦æ¬¡åä½åå LDï¼è¿ä¸ªæ¸¸æä½éä¸å¤§ï¼æ²¡æåæ³æä»¬åªæä¸¤ä¸ªäººï¼èä¸é½ä¸ä¼ç¾å·¥ï¼ï¼è¿ç§72å°æ¶åä¸æ¬¾æ¸¸æçæ¹å¼æºåºæ¿çï¼å¯ä»¥æ²»ä¸ä¸æä»¬çæå»¶çï¼æä»¬ä»¥åä¹ä¼ç»§ç»­åæ´å¤å¥½ç©çæ¸¸æï¼å¸æå¤§å®¶å¤å¤æ¯æ",

Hope you enjoy!\n\nAll code, sprites and sounds were created by me.\nFont used is Arch Rival and can be found here:  https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/SF-Arch-Rival\n\n## Description\n\nBaby is an egg. For some reason, your species gives birth in the middle of space. It\u0027s pretty dangerous out there. You need to protect baby until it grows up and can fend for itself. Keep it alive!\n![screensho1.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b523.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n[A] and [D] - rotate your ship around the egg\n\n[J] - fire bullets\n\n[L] - grab the nearest item, when it is fully charged\n\n\n## Gameplay\n\nHealth - This is the health of you and Baby combined. Don\u0027t let it drop to zero or you will lose.\n\nGrab - When this bar is full you can pull the closest item towards you to give it to Baby.\n\nGrowth - You win when this timer is full.\n\n\nBaby will randomly get bored, hungry or thirsty. Getting it the correct item will boost the growth bar, but providing the wrong item will decrease it!\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b525.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b527.png)\n\n## Tips\n\nYou can destroy items you don\u0027t want by shooting them. Remember, you can only grab the item closest to you.",

In setting up for Ludum Dare, I decided I wanted to make a game that instilled a sense of calm and thoughtfulness, rather than one of manic action.\n\n For this reason, I took inspiration from the Mathematician John Conway, who passed away earlier this week. \n\nConway is best known for his âGame of Lifeâ -   âa never ending  simulation of cell duplication. He was an influence for me, as well as many others in Music ,Art and Games.  In the game, cells can only survive if they can join together. If they do they can create things of wonderful complexity.\n\n While Johnâs cells joined together for survival, we have been forced to distance ourselves. I found this both ironic and tragic. At this time, the hardest thing to keep alive is our sense of self.\n\n This game is not intended to be played for long. Perhaps it isnât a game at all.  It is a space for your thoughts and reflections. You can use it how you like.  I hope you have a great Game Jam.",

Training it will help with working speed but working and training does take the shine off life a bit.\n\nPats are free though.

Training will increase your pets work speed (hidden) however it really doesn\u0027t like training!\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n![V1-0 gameplay.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b664.png)\n\n![V1-0 tutorial.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b666.png)\n\n![StartScreen.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b667.png)\n\n*This game was made for Ludum Dare 46 Compo, a 48 hour solo Game Jam.*\n\nThe game was developed from scratch in an empty Unity project.

In one moment I was really close to stop my LD jam. But then I found this fantastic platformer mechanic which make my platformer totally epic. I know this mechanic has more potential then I put into my levels but I dont want to create hard unplayable game, like I did last time :). Pls let me know what you think about this game mechanic, did you saw that in any game?\n\nIn this game you are jinxed to have your heart outside of your body and you must take care about it. Keep it alive to the finish flag, thats it.\n\nControls:\n-horizontal movement \n\n-up arrow to jump! \n\n-space to speed up the cycle\n\n\nfollow my twitter https://twitter.com/OneGuystruggle\n\n\nUsed agme engine UNITY, audio recorded in Audacity, \"art\" in paint.net\n\nif you find a heartbreaking bug or you are not able to run the game pls let me know in the comment section\n\n\n",

Seemed like a good time to combine both.\n\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/1e7/z/2bc65.png)![screen2.png](///raw/1e7/z/2bc67.png)\n\n\nOverall I\u0027m very pleased that I got a compo entry in on time, and with the core loop closed, level and scores and all those bits that make a game, a game. It doesn\u0027t always work out like this!\n\nThat said, there are some janky bits in the animation that given more time, I would sort out. First on my list for improvements though would be adding some feedback when you achieve your objectives, or beat your personal best, and of course having the scores persist between sessions.\n\nThe \"music\" is the laziest composition ever but I wanted to be able to tick the music box. Vangelis I am not.\n\nThere is some humor lurking too if you know where to look, it\u0027s very low key though. The real joke of course is in the source code.\n\nObligatory tech notes:\n\nEngine: Unity3D\nArt: Paint.net\nMusic: https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/",

Secondly, there are three difficulties in the game. You can make your own choice. There are three props in the game: stopping all enemies, enlarging the sphere, and letting all enemies lose a drop of blood. There are two kinds of enemies in the game: ordinary enemies and sprint enemies\n\n\nSince I donât know art, I used game asset on the Internet, so I had to develop the Jam team.

        "body":  "Hi, this is my entry for LD46 \"Keep it alive\"!\n\nIn this game you have an aquarium and start with 2 fish. Your job is to keep your fish healthy and alive so they can populate. For that you can give your fish food, a cleaning or repair the oxygen pump! You also can reset the cooldowns, because the more fish you have, the more they need their needs.\n\nControls are fairly simple, click on the icons in the top left to apply one of the effects. The pump has to additionially be clicked with the wrench! \n\nF - fast reset the first cooldown that needs a reset (from left to right)  \nALT - show debug information (some data about fish and pump)  \nM - to unmute/mute music\n\nThe game is over, when you don\u0027t have any fishes anymore.\nAll assets and code have been made by myself, but this time with no sound effects from myself because I thought it would be weird when the fishy sounds everytime something happens.\n\nThanks for reading and playing, if you leave a comment I will definitely check out your game aswell!\n\n![bestgif.gif](///raw/3cd/e/z/2b4d1.gif)",

Instead of a pet, you must keep an adventurer alive while she fights monsters and collects loot.\n\nThe adventurer performs actions herself. As she adventures she will gain gold, which the player can use. However performing actions deplete her resources: HP and hunger. If either resource is completely depleted the adventurer will die â .\n\nYou can replenish her resources by spending gold to play a timed mini-game. You replenish more resources the better you perform in the mini-game.\n\n## Controls\n\n|          | Movement | Action |\n| -------- | -------- | ------- |\n| Keyboard | WASD     | Spacebar |\n| Gamepad  | Left Joystick | A |\n\n![ld46_ss2.png](///raw/873/3/z/2b866.png)\n\n## Tools\n\nEverything was made using the [Pixelbox.js](https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox) game engine.",

The concept is to stay alive as long as you can by spreading the blob to adjacent land tiles. Each tile costs energy to consume, but gives energy back over time from the resources it devours.\n\n## About The Developer\n\n**Giant Blobs From Mars** was developed for Ludum Dare 46 by **Billy McDaniel** under the name of **Almighty Games**. I am known for publishing games on Steam, teaching video game development on Udemy and streaming game design on Twitch. I am currently building an expansive collection of low-poly 3D environment assets which will appear in many of the online marketplaces very soon.\n\nIt\u0027s probably worth mentioning that I am also an accomplished musician and performed and recorded the music tracks for this game as well. The recordings are all first draft, very quick improvisation with all of the slurs and imperfections left in place.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot 2.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd6.png)\n\n![screenshot 4.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd9.png)\n\n",

        "body":  "\n\n[The website will self-destruct](https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com) if you don\u0027t engage with it.\n\nIt\u0027s been a rough month for me, and I\u0027m sure it has for a lot of people.  So I figured, lets create a nice cozy place online where you can write about the issues you\u0027re having.\n\nPlease feel free to read some of the messages that have been left so far, and send one yourself.\n\n--\n\nA little more information about the thought process behind making this, and some of the process after the initial release.\n\nI acknowledge this is about as little of a \u0027game\u0027 as it can come.  \n\nI\u0027d initially come up with the self-destructive website that requires interaction.  Then I was imagining how we could turn that into a game.  My first thought was that this reminds me of something like entering the numbers in Lost, but is more interactive.\n\nI was thinking through interesting things people could do to interact with it.  I\u0027d love to do something that requires getting to a particular location, or performing some tasks.  First I was thinking the system could verify these via an API, but anything interesting that was gamey seemed to go against social distancing guidelines.\n\nThen, I was considering something closer to the Taskmaster #hometasking tasks.  If you\u0027re not aware, there have been tasks every day or two where you have between 5 and 30 hours to complete some task, and take a 20 second video of it.  It\u0027s been a really positive, joyful thing to watch a ton of 20 second clips of people performing silly, funny, entertaining tasks like \u0027turn your bathroom into a fun place to hangout.\u0027\n\nBut after some reflection, they\u0027ve got that covered.  And I encourage you to check it out.\n\nWhat I realized the best thing I could do with the idea, even if it might make it seem less like a game, is to encourage people to write openly and honestly about their lives in a completely ephemeral space.\n\nHonestly, that was my theory, but I wasn\u0027t sure how well people would respond to it, but the responses have been amazing.  I\u0027ve read stories that have been heartbreaking, encouraging, kind, compassionate, and hilarious.  Some people just want to give the website a bit of love, but many many more than I ever could have expected have used it to share something honest.\n\n--\n\nA couple of developer notes and design decisions:\n\nThe Heart button really does record hearts/likes, but this is just kept on the backend.  I\u0027d considered exposing that data, but I don\u0027t think encouraging any kind of \u0027like-hunting\u0027 behavior is necessarily what I\u0027m going for here.  I just want an outlet for sending positivity.  And I think that a broken button doesn\u0027t feel as honest as a real button that\u0027s really doing something.\n\nThe self-destruction mechanism works by checking every page-load that it hasn\u0027t been 24 hours since the last post.  If it has, it immediately deletes all the records in the database.  The counter at the top of the page reflects the real time remaining, and is updated every 90 seconds, so it\u0027ll tick back up after someone posts a new letter.\n\nInitially, I\u0027d planned on only letting you \u0027Read a message\u0027 after sending a message, but shorty after I started testing I realized that it was nice to come back and read a message later.  I could have kept a cookie on someone\u0027s computer, but that felt more invasive than this should be. \n\nI\u0027ve had to build a small moderation tool, since about 5% of the responses are generally hurtful.  I\u0027m not filtering via word choice, since I think it\u0027s reasonable to want to use expletives right now.  Instead, I\u0027m manually reviewing the messages as they come in.\n\nThanks so much for reading.",

Questions about that? :)\n\n### Objective\nThe objective is to protect your egg (your baby) as long as you possibly can.\n\n### How to play\n* Control the chicken and aim with the ARROW-keys, the WASD-keys or your mouse (only horizontal)\n  * TIP: Use the W and D keys to turn fast, and the mouse to aim more precisely \n* Shoot with the SPACE BAR-key or the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON\n* Use the MINIMAP, it\u0027s a great tool to keep track of the enemies\n* Pick upp ammo on the ground, they will increase your weapon damage\n* Press N at anytime to play the next music track\n\n![mgc_ld02.gif](///raw/159/f2/z/2c43e.gif)\n\n### Enemies\nEnemies have different stats:\n* The girl has very little health but she is very fast\n* The police has heavy armor and can therefore take more damage\n* The zombie is a monster with a lot of health, but is very slow\n* Enemies health and spawn rate increase the longer you survive\n\n![mgc_ld03.gif](///raw/159/f2/z/2c49b.gif)\n\n### Feedback\nThank you for taking time to check out my game. Please don\u0027t forget to leave feedback :)",

Those pesky ants want to destroy your hive and eat all the honey you have produced. You control an assembly of bees, and your goal is a simple one: ***to protect your Queen.*** By defeating ants you render the bee Queen safe and simultaneously *keep it alive*.\n![ss5.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08b.png)\nAbout the game\n====\nChoose from several types of bee units and actions and try to stop swarms of ants from reaching your Queen bee. The game is turn based and requires you to build a simplified economy model in order to provide necessary currency to buy lines of defense. \nSince the game was created solely for Ludum Dare 46 its content is restricted. Nonetheless the player may choose from four units, each having different abilities in order to stop unrelenting hordes of ants. Currently ant enemies come in two variants, differing in health points. \n\nSince there is no tutorial, please refer to the following guide:\n\n*During your turn you can place new units as well as order attacks.\n*During enemy turn the ants move towards the Queen and if they have already encountered a bee, they attack it. The Counterattack of bees is automatic. Beware though, collectors are vulnerable and defenseless!\n*At the beginning of own turn collectors generate honey which acts the in-game currency.\n*You lose if an ant reaches the queen.\n* You win if you survive all waves of enemies.\nEvery wave there are more of enemies and tougher ants are more common.\nPlayable bees:\n\n* collector - a simple drone that has a 50% of generating an unit of honey at the beginning of each turn,\n* beeguard - a powerful defensive unit capable of holding and tackling even toughest enemies,\n* strike unit - a one-use only order to sting a chosen enemy for 1 point of damage,\n* trike team - a devastative attack launched at an enemy of your choosing for 3 damage.\n![ss6.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08c.png)\nAbout author\n====\nThe game was created in Unity and Photoshop by me, Ian Burr, an owner of YouTube channel focused on teaching game development and programming.\n\nWARNING\nSince the game is in a somewhat high resolution, the browser version is not displaying correctly. Please refer to downloadable executable for best experience.",

You place turrets along the brainwaves connected to your brain. Once turrets have been placed they can be sold again - however roughly 50% of the value is lost.\n\nThe price when placing turrets is losing focus which together with quality determines your \"Ludum Dare placement\" (rank within the game.\n\nEnemies periodically eat of both quality and focus - especially once they reach your brain.\n\nHave a fantastic day :smile: :sunny: \n\n:purple_heart: :dart: :frog: \n\nCONTROLS:\n\nClicks on the brainwaves once a type is selected constructs a turret in that position. (Waves light up with green indicators when selected).\n\nShortcuts:\n\n\t0: Clear selected tower.\n\n\t1: Build Fixer Tower (versus bugs).\n\n\t2: Build In the zone Tower (versus sunny weather).\n\n\t3: Build Coffenator Tower (slows every that is enemy hit - also good damage on sports).\n\n\tQ: Sell Turret.\n\n\n\n\tC: Cheat (Clear active wave).\n\n\tL: Loose on purpose.\n\n\tD: Delete highscore (not verified).\n\n\tP: Pause game.\n\n\tR: Restart game.\n\n\tM: Toggle Music.\n\n\tESC: Quit",

The normal graduation period is 5 years, and it may be postponed up to 8 years.\n\nYou can see my graduation requirements and my current status. Every turn, I have 7 initial points of energy and different things I can do according to my status. When the energy is not enough, you can click the âNext turnâ button to refresh.\n\nI\u0027ll trouble you in the next five years. Pay more attention to my attributes.
