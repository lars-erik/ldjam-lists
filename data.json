Use this to get it over the roads. Move the farmer with the mouse. The farmer will always move toward the mousecursor. Press left mousebutton to give the chicken an extra boost. (You need to be close to the chicken otherwise it will not work).\n\n",

The horror!\nBy pure accident Phil noticed the smell of coffee from a unicorn nearby, and desperate to get coffee, he caught it and tried to figure out where the smell came from and how to turn, whatever it was, into a nice cup of liquid caffeine.\nSo most important is to **keep** the **Unicorn** **alive**, to keep the flow of coffee coming. And what could be simpler than feeding it exactly what it needs? Nothing, just keep going.\n\n\n**Controls:**\n- Move - wasd or arrow keys\n- Pickup stuff - Space (hold)\n- Do action - e (Open close gate, toggle switch, draw water from well)\n\nThat\u0027s it, just try to figure it out. No tutorial here! Only learning by doing.\n\nKnown bugs:\nStanding on a coffeebean while feeding the Unicorn, will prevent you from picking it up! Workaround, just walk away from the bean and back on it.\n",

It was also much quicker through development than my previous submissions, and somehow I never felt pressured for time, even after polishing! It was also nice to work with more familiar programs, and to be able to use a DAW better than Bosca for music (REAPER can be got as a free trial version, but it seemingly never expires).",

Tulip needs to eat colored flowers to stay alive.  Can you pluck and feed them to Tulip fast enough?\n\n**Controls:**\n\nWASD or Controller - Movement\nSpace/Click/Fire - Pluck flower or feed Tulip\n\nâThere is no end to this game.  The goal is to see how long you can last before Tulip passes out from lack of nutrition.\n\n**Jam Notes**\n\nâMy goal with this Ludum Dare was to create a game my kids could have fun playing.  This game was intended to be easy to play, fun to look at and silly.  I hope it makes you smile.\n\nTools used: Unity, ZBrush, Unity, Substance Designer, Photoshop, Audacity, FL Studio\n\n![Screen_4.png](///raw/c06/z/2bf50.png)",

Would have liked to ironed out some of the pick up/drop behaviour but it works for the most part!\n\nBuilt using:\n- Phaser 3\n- VSCodium\n- Aseprite\n- Bfxr\n- Tiled\n- Wolfram Tones",

There are just some strange circles into a playground bound via rules.\n\nSo I ask you to use your **IMAGINATION** a bit. \n\n...2020. Self-isolation and loneliness. We need to stay home to protect our friends and families, we aren\u0027t? But one `*****` always needs to move somewhere. It\u0027s a hamster. :hamster: When it stops, it dies. When it moves, it lives. Only other blue medical orderly hamsters can stop this crazy hamster using a special sleeping pill. You know these pills don\u0027t work properly. They are killing every hamster around. \n\nSo I offer to play hamster and KEEP IT ALIVE as longer as you can. Let\u0027s break the serious rules only in the games. Are you agreed?\n\nI hope you\u0027ll enjoy moving ~~an orange circle~~ the hamster and avoiding these nasty white ~~bullets~~ pills.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GU4052eCvGM\n",

No fancy controls.\n\nIt\u0027s been developed over two days for Ludum Dare 46\u0027s compo. I\u0027ve made everything from scratch except the font (Bahnschrift) using Unity, C#, Blender, sfxr, Bosca Ceoil, Audacity and Adobe Photoshop. To create the original spacerock texture, I transformed two free texture packs available on https://3dtextures.me.â Also, everything is inspired, of course, by the original design of the Shadoks. That\u0027s why I opted-out the \"Mood\" category.\n\nThis is one of my first experiences. I started C#, Unity and Blender 8 months ago and had to learn by myself. Every piece of advice or critique will be very appreciated, but please remember I\u0027m new to it.",

You can\u0027t control him, but you see his attack and hp. They hit each other taking turns, until one dies, after that new red square comes (might be stronger!).\n\nPlayer\u0027s objective is to collect tetris shapes.\nShapes have a chance to drop on enemies hit and when enemy dies 3 shapes are always dropped. You have to catch them all!\n\nShapes can be placed in one of 3 fields (or thrown away).\n\n**Blue left field**\n\nAny full horizontal lines will dissapear and player will be healed by 1 for each block\n\n**Red right field**\n\nPlayers attack gets charged, increasing damage on next attack (only one attack). If 25 blocks collected, damage permanently increased\n\n**Green bottom field**\n\nThis is sort of inventory field, shapes can be placed there temporarly and taken when needed, unlike other fields where shapes are put permanently\n\n\n\nHope you like it!\n\np.s. this is my first entry where I tried to make my own music, didn\u0027t have much time for that unfortunately.

The dream that maybe, just maybe, the throw will make the baby reach orbit, and it will be gone forever.\n\n![Cover.png](///raw/c41/f2/z/2bfef.png)\n\n3 Tips to become a hero:\n\n- Give the baby what it wants. \n\n- Don\u0027t hold the baby too long, we all know babies are little puke machines. \n\n- Birds are stupid and annoying and always in the way and I hate them so very very much. \n\nGood luck and please share your highscores!

        "body":  "In **Your Pet Alien**, your objective is to care for your pet while also keeping your family from finding it. \n\nUse your **Closet** to **hide it**, and use your **Bed** to **heal it**. Every sound that you or your pet makes attracts your mom\u0027s attention, so you must be very strategic. \n\nFurthermore, doing chores makes your mom less likely to enter your room, and you get an extra bonus if she watches you do chores. You also need to be aware of where in the house she is and how close she is to your room.\n\n*Note: nothing is inherently scary about this game, but the atmosphere may creep some people out. This was influenced by games by Scott Cawthon as well as Baldi\u0027s Basic\u0027s :)*\n\n![LD46 Gif 1.gif](///raw/f22/c/z/2bf5d.gif)",

Just don\u0027t leave for too long or you could lose your plants. \n\nLook out for interactions that pop up to get even more money to get more plants.\n\nThe majority of assets are from various asset packs from the Unreal Market Place with some help on a few extras.

Their experiment: putting heads into jars.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations with the World\u0027s United Sanest Scientists, the key ingredient to the experiment was identified: heads in jars *without the body attached*.\n\nIs is now the even more distant future, the year 201Y.\n\nYou, wearing a kind of a jar on your head, and a creature you can only refer to as ***IT*** are the last of your kind.\n\nYou are the **JarHeads**.\n\n![shot2.png](///raw/133/z/2bfe3.png)\n\nAlso for some reason you have to avoid waves of bullets.",

Use this to balance power if one side is on their last legs.\n- Spears become harmless after touching the ground.\n- My high score is 129 seconds!

Then, use those resources to build more and get upgrades.\n\n![ImageBar1.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be75.png)\n\n## Instructions\n* Start by building some simple roots. Roots collect water and nutrients. Nutrients are essential for building more in the future.\n* Add some branches up top. Sunlight can be used for upgrades.\n* Get upgrades! The bugs can become a problem. You don\u0027t want them hanging around.\n* Get even bigger. There is nothing stopping you. Only rule, stay alive!\n\n### Resources\nThe three resources are water, nutrient, and sun. If any three of these reach 0 your tree will start to die. Be extra careful with nutrient, it is essential to expand and it is impossible to obtain it again if you run out.\n\n### Building\nTo start building roots or branches, press the build button located on the top of the screen. Then, use your mouse to select a starting location. This location must be on the tree. Next, pick an ending location. This location will be the point the branch will grow out to. If the line is red, it can not be built. The amount of nutrient required to build is shown next to your cursor.\n\n*Note: Branches can\u0027t go down and roots can\u0027t go up. Also, they can not cross.*\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-19 at 5.25.20 PM.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be7b.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n| Input | Function |\n|---|---|\n| `W` `A` `S` `D`  `Arrows` | Move Camera |\n| `Left Mouse` |  Select |",

In the middle of a rest cycle, Gale receives new instructions from the impossible. Could it be that humans have given new orders?\n\n======\n\nSunset Directive is a work of interactive fiction. I chose to do interactive fiction this time around because I have been working on Casementâ, an interactive engine for Twine. Sunset Directive uses Casement for inventory interactions, examination windows, and conversations. A good amount of changes happened during the jam, since this was the first time I put it to use! Several issues need to be worked out. \n\nSince Sunset Directive is choice-based interactive fiction, all you should need is your mouse or a mobile device. It should work fine on mobile (I put in extra queries for some of the windows at portrait). \n\nA note on mechanics. Casement has a system whereby you can use items that you\u0027re currently looking at (context-sensitive). Sometimes you might be asked for an inventory item, and you\u0027ll need to select it in your inventory. It doesn\u0027t come up too often, though, so I hope it isn\u0027t too confusing! \n\n======\n\nJSON for conversations was generated using the [JSON Online Editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/). It was immensely helpful for getting people talking.\n\nAudio samples were provided by [DSK Music](https://www.dskmusic.com/). Audio was compiled using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/).\n\nThe font used in Sunset Directive is [Quantico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quantico).",

Even though I had planned using some different development systems for each jams, after announcement of theme I decided to develop a hyper-casual game. I wanted to extend it to a casual but that will be on full release I think.\n\nGame is simple, you are trying to protect animals gathered at the center of the screen. There are some alien ships who want to destroy animals. Your goal is preventing aliens as long as possible while not letting animals die from hunger. I am thinking adding some powerups to give some variety to gameplay and maybe a different part to see gathered animals (this is supported in this version to but I did not finished implementation). If you can give me ideas about gameplay that will be very helpfull.\n\nI codded whole game by myself there is only free LeanTween library in addition to my codes. I developed game in Unity. At the start my goal was participating in Jam but whole game finished yesterday so I decided to run for compo. I tried to try out some different tools and styles for graphics and I am aware that neither graphics not musics are good. I don\u0027t have a sense of art I think.\n\nAnyway time to make a game for Jam this time. Enjoy Precious Animals and keep them safe as long as possible for me please.\n\n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002636.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be88.jpg) \n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002716.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be8c.jpg)",

Can you keep it alive?\n\n### Technical stuff\nYou don\u0027t need an account. Details about your tree are stored locally (javascript local storage). If you reload the pag, even if a long time has passed, the tree will show the correct state (as if it was \"running\" the entire time). Actually we just apply the missing time very quickly.\n\n### For Ludum Dare Testers\nThe normal game mode takes about two years for a full grown tree. To make things simpler there are two test game mode.\n\n#### LD46 Mode\nThis is the recommended game mode for LD46 testers. A full grown tree takes about 2h and should be watered about every 15 to 30 minutes.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/LD46/\n\n#### No-Zen Mode\nFor very unpatient players there is an even faster mode. A tree takes about a minute to fully grow.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/FAST/\n",

If I did I would have spent more time working on minigames that better tied in with the spaceship theme and in-game tutorials for them.

Overall though another fun game jam.\n\nHope you Enjoy and Thanks for playing.\n\n![Icon.PNG](///raw/ad8/d1/z/2bde1.png) \n\nHow To Play:\n\nClick on the consoles and play the minigame to fix them as the timers run out.\n\nMinigame 1 : \n\nThe ships self destruct sequence has activated, enter the code shown alphabetically to reset the timer.\n\nMinigame 2: \n\nA distant object is on a collision course, lock the horizontal and vertical aiming bars onto the target and destroy it before its too late.\n\nMinigame 3:\n\nThe Ships navigation system is failing, adjust the navigation screen until a complete image is shown, before you fly into a sun.\n\nTools Used:\n- Unity 2019.3.10f1\n- BFXR 1.5.1\n- GIMP 2.10.18",

By pressing SPACE you are using 1 buff and healing yourself, but also your enemies get higher max hp, full health and random buff to statistics.\n\nTo take control over enemy you must have enaugh points. By taking control over hostile your old ship destroys itsfelf, and you get as many random buffs as you made in past. \nAlso all of enemies instantly explode and loose all buffs.But be careful. After taking over your health falls faster and enemies are spawning more frequently. \n\nSo enjoy playing. But remember - better way to defeat your enemy is to keep it alive and take control over it!\n\n![Scr3.png](///raw/ef5/c2/z/2bd24.png)\n\n\n![Scr4.png](///raw/ef5/c2/z/2bd8d.png)\n",

The objective of the game is to direct incoming blood cells to their respective \"tubes\". Each cell has a colour associated with it.\n\n# Objective\nSimply try to last as long as you can. Your score is counted by how many cells you direct successfully. Your \"heart rate\" adjusts accordingly depending on how well you\u0027re directing cells. If your heart rate reaches zero, you lose!\n\nThe player is able to \"collect\" a maximum of 3 cells at a time. Use the spacebar to release them as you want. After 3 cells are stored, any other cells that try to enter will be destroyed and your heart rate will reduce.\n\nThe game also features two \"power ups\" - a BPM boost, and a movement speed increaser.\n\n# Controls\n* Left/Right: Movement\n* Spacebar or Down arrow: Release cell.\n* P: Pause. (Alternatively click in bottom-left corner of screen.)\n\n*Only 64-bit Windows is supported. Sorry.*\n\n# To run the game\n* Download the .rar archive and extract somewhere using WinRAR, WinZip, or 7Zip, etc.\n* Run the executable file, \u0027Bloody Fantastic.exe\u0027\n\n# Made with\n* Unity3D\n* gVim\n* Paint.NET\n* Audacity\n* Bosca Ceoil\n\nEnjoy and please rate!",

I didnât spend nearly as much time on it as Iâd liked but at least I have a complete game. Itâs not very good and the music is pretty bad but itâs complete (in a very minimal-viable-product way). So Iâm pretty happy with myself, this is a step in the right direction that will hopefully lead to better games in the future.",

Sadly, they always find the electric sockets, dangerous kitchen tools and furnitures, and... well... and everything that is not for them.\n\nBe a better dad in real life than in this game.\n\n## Controls / Hints\n\n- Move Dad: WASD\n- Grab / Drop Child: SPACE\n\n### Tips / Points / Notes\n\nGrab and put away them from dangerous things. Keep in mind, while you\u0027re holding any of them, the points will not increase.\n\n- **Any changes will be mentioned in the Change Log.**\n- **I could only test on OSX and in browser.**\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot 2020-04-19 at 22.29.38.png](///raw/44d/71/z/2bc88.png)\n\n## About the Author and the Game\n\nI\u0027m mudlee, father of one and a hobbist game dev. This is my 5th jam, but the first LD.\n\nIn the beginning I started a completely different game in Twine, but after a half a day I threw all of my plans into trash and started over. Hence, my time was way less as I expected.\nOriginally I planned that the dad has to cook, clean and to do other housekeeping activity, but I had no more time for such extras.\n",

        "body":  "![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 21-07-32.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2bbfb.png)\n*adventure awaits!*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 11-33-25.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b951.png)\n*picking castles, taking names*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 19-17-26.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b955.png)\n*the tunnels*\n\n### Intro\n\n**Late Medieval Network Engineer** is a game where you play a Network Engineer in the Late Middle Ages, responsible for keeping the connections between a group of castles alive while the King is away. \n\nTo do this, you travel through the tunnels between castles, dealing with technically correct monsters and fearsome HTTP status codes, or possibly the other way around. \n\n### Instructions\n\nControls: Pointer / mouse, but you\u0027ll probably need to be on a laptop (or tablet) to see the whole screen. There are instruction modals in the game, but just in case: \n\nGameplay is split into two phases. In the overworld, you must choose a castle to travel to from your current castle (which will have a blue marker around it). Once you\u0027ve chosen a castle, a red marker will appear underneath it. You can then travel by clicking the \"travel\" button in the left-hand pane. \n\nTravelling takes 1 day. You have to survive for 14 days. \n\nWhile travelling, you enter the other phase of the game. You are underground and must choose a route through a sequence of cards which will affect your status and the status of the tunnel you\u0027re in. You choose from the top row of cards, again using the mouse. Depending on your last choice of card, between 2 and 3 of this top row will be selectable. Cards not adjacent to your previous position will not be selectable. \n\nThe goal overall is to keep the network of tunnels healthy and also not die yourself. At the end of every turn, the network will suffer random damage which it is your job to repair.\n\n### Theme \n\nI went with this design because the theme reminded me of the [keep-alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) HTTP header, so I wanted to create something that was kind of HTTP but not really. In this game, you are keeping a network alive. \n\n### Details\n\nThis game was made using [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and my own tool for procedurally making sprites, [pixel-factory](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/). \n\nI like pixel-factory because it lets me keep writing JavaScript all the way through the jam without breaking flow and changing to another tool. You can see an example [here](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/#eyJ3IjoiMTI4IiwiaCI6IjEyOCIsImYiOltbeyJ0IjoiY29uc3QgeG9mcyA9IDA7XG5jb25zdCB5b2ZzID0gMTY7XG5jb25zdCBhbHBoYSA9IDAuNTtcblxuZWxsaXBzZSh7eDogNjQgKyB4b2ZzLCB5OiA5NiArIHlvZnMsIHJYOiAzMiwgclk6IDEyfSkuZmlsbCh3aXRoQWxwaGEoY29sb3JzWzFdLCBhbHBoYSkpIiwidiI6dHJ1ZSwibiI6InNoYWRvdyJ9LHsidCI6ImFyYyh7eDogNjQsIHk6IDY0LCByOiA1NH0pLmZpbGwoXCIjYzJjXCIpXG5hcmMoe3g6IDY0LCB5OiA2NCwgcjogNDZ9KS5maWxsKFwiIzUwNVwiKVxuXG5hcmMoe3g6IDY0LCB5OiA2NCwgcjogMjB9KS5maWxsKFwiIzIwMlwiKVxuXG5cblxuXG5cbmxldCByID0gMzY7XG5sZXQgeCA9IDk7XG5mb3IobGV0IGkgPSAwOyBpIDwgMTI7IGkrKyl7XG4gIGNvbnN0IGFuZ2xlID0gMiAqIE1hdGguUEkgKiBpIC8gMTI7XG5cblxuICB0cmlhbmdsZSh7eDogNjQgKyByICogTWF0aC5jb3MoYW5nbGUpLCB5OiA2NCArIHIgKiBNYXRoLnNpbihhbmdsZSksIHI6IHgsIGFuZ2xlOiBhbmdsZSAtIE1hdGguUEl9KS5maWxsKFwiI2ZlZVwiKVxufVxuXG5cbnIgPSAyMDtcbnggPSA1O1xuZm9yKGxldCBpID0gMDsgaSA8IDEyOyBpKyspe1xuICBjb25zdCBhbmdsZSA9IDIgKiBNYXRoLlBJICogaSAvIDEyICsgMC4zO1xuXG5cbiAgdHJpYW5nbGUoe3g6IDY0ICsgciAqIE1hdGguY29zKGFuZ2xlKSwgeTogNjQgKyByICogTWF0aC5zaW4oYW5nbGUpLCByOiB4LCBhbmdsZTogYW5nbGUgLSBNYXRoLlBJfSkuZmlsbChcIiNmZWVcIilcbn0iLCJ2Ijp0cnVlLCJuIjoiIn1dXSwiYyI6WyIjYzBiOWIzIiwiIzEwMTAxMCIsIiM5Nzc1NDYiLCIjMzMzMzMzIiwiIzQ0NDQ0NCIsIiM1NTU1NTUiLCIjNjY2NjY2IiwiIzc3Nzc3NyIsIiM4ODg4ODgiLCIjOTk5OTk5IiwiI2FhYWFhYSIsIiNiYmJiYmIiLCIjY2NjY2NjIiwiI2RkZGRkZCIsIiNlZWVlZWUiLCIjZmZmZmZmIl19) -- this is the worm card used in-game.\n\nI\u0027m pretty happy with the results (it\u0027s the first jam I\u0027ve used it for). Generally I think sprites went well with a couple of notable exceptions (health bars in the tunnels, probably a few others). \n\nI didn\u0027t get around to audio and wish I had now -- next jam I need to write less code and use more tools! \"amount of source code produced\" and \"how fun the game is\" are pretty much completely unrelated :smile: \n\nThanks for playing and reading, I appreciate it! \n",

So yeah, keep some of them alive too, just a small tips.\n\nThere\u0027s also a multi mode where you have to be selfish to get your own fire alive, but have to steal things and maybe try to bother a bit your opponent, last fire on fire win.\n\nAbout the author:\nI\u0027m fairly new to game dev (2 months) and this is obviously my first game jam, and this is litteraly an old dream becoming true. I learned a lot during these two last days, and i had a lot of fun coding this, so, i\u0027ll hope you will have fun too trying this out :)",

I had been programming for few years already but still was stuck with Visual Basic (well at least not QBasic anymore). My friend was also just getting into programming and together we hacked up this very simple game in few hours and most likely spent way more hours playing it and competing for high scores. The game was very crude but somehow weirdly fun and addictive. It came to my mind and I wanted to try to see if I could capture that magic again. The game ended up not being very close the the original mechanically but the same essence is still there.\n\n**Flock for Feast** is an arcade style single screen score-attack game where you just try to stay alive as long as possible and rack up major points. You\u0027re in control of a flock of birds that are preyed upon by a vicious monster.\n\n---\n\n### ð®ð¹ï¸ [Download or play online on itch.io](https://anttihaavikko.itch.io/flock-for-feast) ð¹ï¸ð®\n\n---\n\n![fff-cover-v2.gif](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99b.gif)\n\n---\n\n### ð ï¸ Tools used\n- Unity 2019\n- Adobe Illustrator\n- Bfxr\n- Garage Band\n\n---\n\n### ðï¸ Gameplay video\n[Gameplay video](https://youtu.be/RB8JqLaN7dQ)\n\n### ð¥ Dev timelapse\n[Dev timelapse](https://youtu.be/DmwvkJ3IMrc)\n\n---\n\n### ð¥ï¸ Screenshots\n![a.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99d.jpg) \n\n![c.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99e.jpg) \n\n![d.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a0.jpg)\n\n![e.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a5.jpg) \n\n![f.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a6.jpg)\n",

You will select a spirit and then utilize it in a Pokemonesque series of battles until you either fail to **keep it alive** or you triumph over the evil Demon Prince who threatens to destroy the land. Your journey will take you see many strange foes. Will you fight the legendary Ice Lobster or the ancient Lava Golem the choice is your with this games branching level select. Also this game features an option menu on the title screen which is always nice.\n\n\n**Instruction**: While the game does feature in game instructions on the main menu as well as in the description of the various pages the HTML5 version is on I will restate what is said there here for the sake of those who need it.\n\nThis game is controlled entirely by the mouse.\nAfter selecting your spirit you will be taken to a map to select one of the highlighted letters this will start your journey.\nIn battle you have four option\n - Attack which deals damage to the enemy and expends all your boost\n - Defend which reduced the damage you take and expends all your boost\n - Boost which multiples either your next attack or defense by how many boost you have stored.\n - Meditate which calms your mind and heals your spirit for a quarter of its current health;\n\n**Mac and Linux Support** as this game was made in unity I went ahead and built for both Mac and Linux feel free to download them but I lack a machine to test these builds on so I would expect that there are probably some bugs in these versions that I am completely unaware of sorry if this makes the game unplayable for you Mac and Linux users.",

Thanks for checking it out.\n\n\nThe idea of the game was, that you have to sacrifice small minions to keep the monster alive. Sadly there is no goal or threat, just have fun with it though!\n\n![imageA.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc05.jpg)\n\n![imageB.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc06.jpg)![cover.JPG](///raw/964/1/z/2bc07.jpg)",

Each person has a 3x3 pattern that they want to hear. If you click on the buttons to light them and match a player\u0027s preference, they\u0027re jump around in excitement.

After you\u0027re plane has crashed in the middle of the Ocean, your only means of survival is a fishing rod. From a nearby rock, you must sit and fish to pass the time and to keep yourself alive. Surprisingly, fighting for your life can actually be pretty chill. \n\nThe game has 2 game modes to choose from:\n\n\n**Survival: **\nWith a timer counting down to your demise, you must catch fish to gain more time. Each fish adds a varying amount of time, small fish offer 5 seconds, medium sized fish offer 10 and large fish awarding a whopping 20 additional seconds of sweet sweet life. \n\n\n**Peaceful: **\nIt\u0027s just fishing, but without the shoe horned timer mechanics that I added to match the theme some what. Just relax and catch some fish. \n\n**How to play:**\nLeft click to cast your line, left click to reel it back in. \nWhen a fish is on the hook, smash left click repeatedly to reel it in. Larger fish require more clicks and will stay on the line for less time. Pull up with the mouse to reduce the number of clicks needed. \n\nYou can press \u0027R\u0027 to restart at any time and \u0027ESC\u0027 to exit to the main menu. ",

This might sound easy at first, but it is not - and to be honest, I haven\u0027t done any programming for years (and didn\u0027t participate since LD17) so was a bit rusty to say the least.\n\nThe results; a simulator with questionable graphics, questionable sound, questionable game mechanics - but hey! - That is the results of my priorities in life!\n\nThanks for showing interest :)\n// Sune\n\n--\n\nThe GAME!\n\nThe concept is simple (and displayed on the beautiful non-virus intro page): balance the important measurable parameters in your life (the top 5 bars) by working with what you can spend your time on (the left 7 bars) - and hey!!!! you!!! - don\u0027t cheat looking up my scoring matrix and stuff in the source code!\n\nThe activities on the left helps you either increase or decrease the bars on the top.\n\nYou prioritize morning, midday, afternoon, evening and night (the five squares on the left). You can drag the squares to prioritize what you want to spend your time on with the consequences that follow.\n\nOnce in a while, like in any interesting life, events do happen! - When an event happens you have to deal with it - whether you want it or not - your life simulation cannot continue until then.\n\nThe game gets increasingly harder (basically since you have more plants to care for) so try to see how many days you can survive!\n\nGood luck.\n\n--\n\nThe source code is on GitHub and the game is based on Phaser.io and javascript.",

Thats the base rule to keep the game over away!\n\n## FAQ\n\n### It is lagging?\n\nYes i found out too late p5js has a lot of performance issues for the rendering in e.g. Firefox. Please **use chrome**.\n\n### Out of cash game over!?\n\nCheck out the cash history after your loss. Upgrades and low population are very exspensive. You have daily costs which you have to pay every 3 seconds. \n\n### What tools did you use\n\nSublime Text, Aseprite, p5js\n\n## Actions\n\n### Vitamin C\n\n![apple-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9aa.png)\n\nVitamin C will help your humans to stay longer alive. If you give them enough the chance to get infected will be lower.\n\n### Vaccinate\n\n![vaccine-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9b5.png)\n\nYour humans will be immune for 10 seconds after vaccination.\n\n### Water Storms\n\n![flooding-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9fb.png)\n\nNo Casino, no fun! Use this action carefully! It has hidden costs and it can rescue you in bad situations, make your total population strong for short periods or cause the worst infection you have ever seen.\n\n### Masks\n\n![human-mask-frame-04.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9bd.png)\n\nMasks will make your humans immun for one possible upcoming infection.\n\n### Money\n\n![inflation-5.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c6.png)\n\nMoney is important to keep live here. Print so much you can!!!\n\n### Trucks\n\n![truck-1.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c9.png)\n\nThe game will get harder the longer you survive. With the trucks it is possible to reduce the mortality. But be careful, this action has hidden costs.\n\n### Breed\n\n![birth-3.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9ce.png)\n\nNo humans, no economy. Breed as much as possible. 100 population is max. Low population will increase the daily costs. So keep the population up.\n\n### Execute sick\n\n![execute-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9d8.png)\n\nYou have trouble with infections? Just shoot them. A dead human can not infect others. Fast and effective!\n",

I haven\u0027t even written a single line of code in that time, but it was a nice feeling to be back. Surprisingly, the whole development cycle went very smoothly. Scope was exact and achievable in the given timeframe, which was very unusual for me just a few years ago. It also has a narrative, which was impossible to fit in before (a feat of which I am very proud). I will attempt to fix any crashes on launch or game-breaking bugs even after release, but I will leave the original version available at all times. You can see any of the changes made here or on my github in the following weeks. I will also be making a full developer commentary and timelapse of the development, which I will embed here when available. I look forward to hearing what you think of my game.\n\n\n***19 April, 2020 - 23:19***\n\nThe first wave of feedback was mostly how easy it is to cheese the game by spamming bullets off-screen and killing everything. There is code in place to despawn bullets at a certain range, but it seems that it wasn\u0027t enough. I implore you to try going through the game without spamming the fire button. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience. This will eventually will be fixed in the post-compo version. Thanks for understanding.",

Word came to the throne of a bastard son, who shall rename unnamed from this day forth. The King\u0027s brother shall usurp the throne and has declared he will reign with iron hand. If the King\u0027s son, rightful heir to the throne, does not reach the castle alive, this shall be seen as a decree in which the prince relinquishes his right and bloodline...\n\nHis mother, the Lady, has instructed you to move the Prince to the throne, avoiding the Royal guards who have been instructed to stop you.\n\nMove at night... \nMove bravely, but most of all\n...\n\n\n\nKEEP THE PRINCE ALIVE...\n\n****GAMEPLAY****\n\nRun from one safehouse to the next, defeating all royal guards that are trying to take the baby prince. Be careful, once you drop the baby you will not have much time to pick him back up... All guards need to be defeated in order to enter the next safe house.\n\n\n****CONTROLS****\n\nThe control scheme for Long Live The King is extremely simple. You press [F] to wield your staff, use the arrow keys to run around and press the [DOWN] key to pick up the baby in case it was dropped.\n\nLong Live The King is an endless beat em up game developed during Ludum Dare 46, as a Compo submission. This entails that all assets (including audio) and codebase were developed within a timespan of 48 hours.",

You job is to handle the hospital\u0027s traumatology, which consists of sending the injured people to the right department so they will be alive.\n\n#### There are 5 wound types, which belongs to 5 departments shown on boards at the front of the elevators:\n- Broke something (Broken bone board)\n- Burnt something (Fire on board)\n- Some toxic happened (Glass filled with green liquid)\n- Something got in one of the holes on the person for example: ear, mouth (X-ray logo on board)\n- Something caused the person to bleed (Scalpel like thing on board)\n\n#### CONTROL:\nLeft click on patients to select them.\nIf patient selected, then click on the board of any elevator to send them to that department.\n\nRight click\n\nCauses of injury are randomly generated, so there can be some funny cases too. :)\n\nIf 3 patient dies then the game is over.\n\n#####Only the main menu title font is not mine, [Owner can be found here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/starlight.font)\n\n\n##### P.S.:The game is probably not tweaked to be the most enjoyable.",

To pass the levels, small plans of when and where to go are needed.\n\nI didn\u0027t make the levels quiet hard. And the puzzles are not that serious (might be better if the time wasn\u0027t limited to 48 hrs). That means, if you play platformer really well you might finish the level just before the flame dies out without thinking about the strategy.\n\nIt would be better if there was more time. At least this game is able to show that the combination of lightning system and keeping alive can make action game more \"puzzle\" and puzzle game more \"action\".\n\nBtw I made sooooooo many versions of background music to fit the atmosphere. At last I decided to use simple chords loops and make all the sound effects with sounds of instrument rather than record more realistic ones. Well the result is quiet interesting XD\n\n\n![6.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c9.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c4.png)\n\n![7.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c8.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c2.png)\n",

Time to get to work...\n\nHow to play: The game is over after 20 rounds or if you have 5 police tokens. You will need to buy cards from your hand and place them on the buildings. End turn to activate the cards effects and get a new hand.\n\nSome cards only activate when other cards are in the same building. For example: You need a keeper, tiger and a customer together in a building to earn money of the customer.\n\nPlay multiple times and find all synergies and combinations.",

        "body":  "__Covid Conundrum__ is a \"civil policy simulator\" that lets users experiment with the health and economic effects of various policies in a fictional county. Your county has 10,000 citizens and it\u0027s your job to keep them going in the best way you see fit.\n\nAll 10,000 citizens are modeled as individual entities. Some work and live in the same town. Others live in one town and work in another. Some don\u0027t work at all.\n\nAs in reality, you don\u0027t know who is carrying the virus--only who has been tested positive. If a town appears stable, there is still a risk in opening it up. On the other hand, prolonged restrictions may make your economy unrecoverable.\n\nYour county hospital has a capacity of 25 patients. Exceeding this amount will dramatically increase the mortality rate.\n\nThe simulation runs for 120 days--from 1 March 2020 to 29 June 2020. It begins in the paused state, and speed can be controlled via the buttons on the lower-left. When all 120 days have been simulated, the option to reset will appear.\n\n__Model Limitations__. The model is \"tuned\" to mimic real-world numbers in rural North Carolina, USA. There are some notable limitations, though. In particular, this model does not take into account traffic in and out of the county beyond a simple \"mutation rate\".\n\nOf course, the project is open source--so you can always modify the model parameters if you feel they\u0027re wrong. The files Simulation.hx, Person.hx, and City.hx contain the simulation parameters. The project was made in Stencyl. You\u0027ll need that, and the \"Text Utils\" extension to recompile the simulation.",

You need to help this orb to complete the mission.\n\nI always wanted to participate in a Ludum Dare jam. Finally I had time to do so. I hope everyone likes this game. Obviously because of the time frame, this game is really simple in terms of gameplay.\n\nThis is actually part of the compo event, so everything in this game was made by me including art, music and sound effects. Also the source code to the unity project is available below.\n\nBecause we are still in this covid-19 situation, I wish the best for everyone here.

You play as Henry and you have to jump around the platforms to reach Alan. In the spirit of the Jam I\u0027ll be uploading this barebones thing but Ill probably update it as a personal project sometime in the future.As a disclaimer you only lose if youre below 0 points and you only lose points if you fail to get Alan within the time limit, no theres no pause screen so either be in for the ride or alt f4 your way out.\n\nIn case you\u0027re lost the controls are purely ASWD/Up-Down-Left-Right (moving left/right and jumping only)\n\nIts super basic and beginnery but I\u0027m really proud of it, finished it right before my mom could rant about my curfew (finished at 1:30am ph) lmao. Not gonna win any awards but ngl saying you finished an entire game in 1 day is great for resumes. Enjoy it yalls.\n\nP.S. about the music, don\u0027t record with your phone. You think it sounds ok, it isn\u0027t. And yes judge everything on here I know im updating it in the future but as a personal project, this is my full submission.\n\n",

So make sure to obliterate those pesky enemies. You can control your character using W/A/S/D, aim using the mouse and fire pressing space (hold for more powah). \n\n*If you run this on an integrated card (Intel) there is a 50/50 chace of it rendering correctly. I don\u0027t have a fix for this sadly. If possible, share the \"log.txt\" with me so I can investigate after the jam.*\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZPdDungvk58\n\nFor those interested, I made the game using Waffle2D a simple rendering framework I made for the jam: https://github.com/piluve/Waffle2D\n",

Play risky to earn big.\n\nWhat awaits you at the bottom of the cave?

You\u0027ll help \"Francky\" to keep pace on the music, while other dancers, jealous of his performance, wil try to disturb him. And so, you\u0027ll need your keyboard and to warm up your fingers , be careful, it\u0027s going to swing!!! There\u0027s a little Tuto in Game with images to help understanding the game\u0027s progress, which is not very complicated. Enough chatting, it\u0027s up to you, let\u0027s play !!! \nKiss From France :p ![Img_01.jpg](///raw/158/e1/z/2b997.jpg)",

This is my first Ludum Dare in a few years, and my seventeenth overall entry, but it\u0027s definitely the one I\u0027ve had the least time for!\n\nRight now you need a few python packages to run this, pymunk pygame pyopengl, but I\u0027ll attempt to package it up for windows tomorrow.![screen2.png](///raw/6db/z/2b9d1.png)",

If someone could tell me I\u0027d like to know!\n\n## Game Description\n\nIn a future where humanity has drained nearly all of it\u0027s natural resources, a group of oddly\narmed environmentalists have found the last tree on the plant. \n\nApparently they\u0027re somehow still able to receive nearly endless shipments of low-tech turrets.\nIn their infinite wisdom, they decide to make a last stand to preserve the last piece of green\nin a sea of gray and dirt...\n\n_**How long can you last?**_\n\n## Controls\n\nThe menus in the game are primarily controlled by arrow keys unless\nexplicitly stated.\n\nThe only mouse interaction is used to place and remove units.\n\n- Tab : In-game will show you the order and amount of enemies that will come.\n- Escape : opens menu or quits game.\n- M : can mute the \"music\"",

        "body":  "**Keep Your Faith Alive** - is my entry for the 46th LudumDare contest. I created (again) a clever puzzle game with cubes. I am proud of what I did, and especially about code because this project does\u0027nt use any collider, raycast, rigidbody or light. All aesthetic and levels are created procedurally. Finally I have a good draw calls value - more or less 20.\n\n\nThe main gameplay is easy to understand but really hard to master. At start, you move a single cube (a monk) using arrow keys so as to reach a star on ground, keeping your unique eye upwards so as to pray some divinity. So you have some epiphany - an illumination and you nourish your faith. After first levels, things are more complicated...\n\n\nMy game has been posted as a **jam** project because as aesthetic I use a shader which I coded a few weeks ago and some useful scripts. Have fun playing. Rate my project and I will rate yours. I wish you the best. Stay At Home :)\n\n**I cannot work more time on this project as I want because I have to work now, delivering thousands surgical masks in Luxembourg door to door. Thanks Covid19 :)**\n\n![Faith01.png](///raw/991/z/2bf86.png)",

Concepts introduced include predicates, sets, and quantifiers. By introducing concepts one at a time in an interactive setting and letting related concepts build on itself, I hope that players will become more comfortable working with these concepts. I was probably a bit sloppy with some notation (for example, the Wikipedia page didnât have examples using sets, so including them might really be an extension of first-order logic or something like that).

Change game\u0027s name half way through! Change the genre half way through! Add features!\n- Buy new stuff in the Asset Store for real fake money! \n- Manage your game! Balance your features and progress against the focus (or, well, boredom) of your team;\n- Hire new people! Fire new people! Their destiny is in your hands! Your destiny is in the hands of the random number generator!\n- Jokes! Not even sorry for most them!\n- Lack of tutorial! An exciting opportunity to venture into the unknown or a cut corner to get the submission out on time? We both know which one it is, but why don\u0027t we pretend it\u0027s fun!\nIt logs your progress! Relieve the fun memories of the past couple of minutes at the very end of your game.\n\nHow To Play:\n\nSo, about that lack of the tutorial.  \n\nThe main goal of the game is to get your game to the finish line. To do that, you must fill all 4 bars (Game Design, Programming, Art and Sound (last one is certainly ironic considering this game\u0027s soundscape)). Each developer you take on the team add points to the bars every couple of seconds (that\u0027s Delay stat). You can review each dev\u0027s stats on the Team screen.\n\nHow do you hire new people then? From the same Team screen. Just pick the devs you like from the list of available people and click them. This list refreshes every once in a while.\n\nNow, making indie games for free for prolonged periods of time leads to the loss of focus and Boredom. That\u0027s the grey bar on top of the bars. Every time it fills -- a developer you hired leaves the project. If you don\u0027t have any more people on the team and you yourself get bored -- that\u0027s Game Over.\n\nSo, how do you prevent it? Change the project over at the Project screen, of course. Add new features, change name, genre or theme -- go nuts. But, obviously, overhauling the project half way through comes at a great (well, -ish) cost. You lose some of the points you already accumulated.\n\nSome people on your team come with free money. Go over to the Store and spend it on assets to boost your bars and alleviate some boredom.\n\nAs your project comes to an end (successfully or not) you will be shown a log of story of your game\u0027s development. \n\nNow that I\u0027m writing this, I realize that you kinda have to Alt+F4 out of the game to start over, but it\u0027s a bit late to change things, huh.",

Unfortunately your new pet seems to have no regard to safety at all and would likely run into the dungeon no weapons, no protection and most importantly no plan!\n![LD 46 1.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89c.png)\nTo make sure your new friend doesn\u0027t die immediately there has been a shop stationed outside the dungeon with all the essentials like: Broad swords, potions and of course pizza!\n![LD 46 4.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89e.png)\nNow for only 8 gold!\nWhere was I oh yes... If you don\u0027t have any money don\u0027t fret the shop has a very lenient policy on selling Items. They\u0027ll buy anything including that bit of slime you carry in your bag for no reason. \n![LD 46 2.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b8a0.png)\nIf you need to get Items just go through the dungeon and kill some of the monsters that lurk there. Although I do need to warn you that improper extraction time (flee at the right time, I like sounding smart) may end up in a swift and unjust death for your friend.\n![LD 46 3.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89f.png)\nUnfortunately your pet doesn\u0027t like running away and will sometimes ignore your cry\u0027s to flee and keep fighting in these situations we advise a dose of steak to keep your pet happy. Happiness does not only keep your pet from dying after IGNORING YOU FOR THE FIFTH TIME!!!! sorry got a bit carried away. An increase in happiness will cause your pet to be more effective during battles.\n\nThank you for reading this explanation on how your pet is going to di... I mean thank you for playing this game I hope you have fun. Tip: When you enter the dungeon your pet gets happier so fleeing isn\u0027t that bad, most of the time.",

        "body":  "It\u0027s a game about managing a band and \"keeping it alive\". But please read the description, what follows is an early little post-mortem of the game.\n\nSo. This is an unusual one.\n\nFor the first time in my Ludum Dare history (6 games + 1MiniLD + 1 warmup) have I failed to complete a game. The result is not very playable and there is no win nor lose conditions and I do not wish to continue to improve it. There are still bugs and the balancing is wildly inconsistent. \n\nI am obviously disappointed in the result but glad of the lesson learned (and I kinda like the Power Metal song name generator) : start small and expand on it. Do not waste time on big stuff and try to check if it is worth it and feasible  before starting to develop it. I spent less times on entries that are way better than this.\n\nI wasted a whole day on the map navigation and trying to add cities to it. In the end the map is useless and there are no cities on it because I approached the problem too naively and it would have required hours of work to place all the cities, for something that wasn\u0027t even needed by the gameplay.\n\nI still want to post the result because there is stuff to show. I barely finished the main gameplay loop with horrendous code during the last hours and now i don\u0027t want to ever place my eyes on it.\nBut I am not ashamed of it. I\u0027m sure it happens everytime to a lot of participants of the Ludum Dare. It\u0027s just part of the risk and I will continue to take part and try to make a more pleasant game next time. I hope all of you who reads this are proud of your creation and hope you get nice reviews. See you on the next jam and rate this entry as harshly as it should be ;)\n\nI have opted out of graphics because the only graphics are the ones in the UI lib and I didn\u0027t draw the world map myself obviously, just modified it to make it \"my own\".\n\n",

Space-bar focuses back on the whole room.\n\nCheck out the [itch.io page](https://quixoticdicker.itch.io/grove) for a web playable version.\n\nThe engine is Unity. Blender for modeling. Gimp for doing some textures. Combination of Adobe Audition and Audacity for audio editing. Garage Band for music.\n\nThis is just the first build, so hopefully I will get a few more things in there.\n\nI want to thank [savannah.smackdown](https://www.instagram.com/savannah.smackdown/) for some help with the audio.",

So our cool guy decided to go to the forest to take some photos of this animals.\nGo! And take as much photos as you can of the wild animals! :smile: \n\n#### Personal note\nThis is my first Ludum Dare game! I learned lots of things during the development and it has motivated me a lot!! I developed this game using my own game engine [Skygine](https://github.com/AsierFox/Skygine) done in SDL2 and I\u0027m so proud of it :)\nI hope that with the experience achived here I can improve my own skills of developmnet and design!! Thank you so much for playing my game and see you in the next LD!! :wink: ",

Plz forgive. ty)\n\nAlso I ran out of snacks, so if I could get an F in the chat from the bois, I\u0027ll be happy. \n\nControls: just push buttons lol you\u0027ll figure it out. Also, like all our games, we have a lil cheat going on. Look on the bottom if you wanna ruin the game.\n\n(some) Artwork: @Rexxe\n\nArtwork, Code, and pretty much everything else: @Nurf\n\nMusic is brought to you by Nurf Records (AKA @Nurf made it, so don\u0027t come and tell us to disable rating for music, he spent very much time on it (like 15 minutes and then removed the vocals, so at least like 17 minutes). You can find it on SoundCloud if you are into that stuff, and it will probably be released on Spotify, because he does that kind of thing.\n\n@YuKey0 freaking ditched me this time, so if you were expecting to see her stuff, then I\u0027m sorry. @Rexxe did her best. (I think). \n\nSeriously, this is good game. We worked very hard on this. \n\nty.\n\n\nAlso, Android version will be put up on Google Play, but for obvious reasons, it won\u0027t be used as the submission, cos google be slow like that.\n\nPermissions required on Android: ![permissions.PNG](///raw/721/4/z/2b7b7.png)\n\n\n\nCTRL key.

In setting up for Ludum Dare, I decided I wanted to make a game that instilled a sense of calm and thoughtfulness, rather than one of manic action.\n\n For this reason, I took inspiration from the Mathematician John Conway, who passed away earlier this week. \n\nConway is best known for his âGame of Lifeâ -   âa never ending  simulation of cell duplication. He was an influence for me, as well as many others in Music ,Art and Games.  In the game, cells can only survive if they can join together. If they do they can create things of wonderful complexity.\n\n While Johnâs cells joined together for survival, we have been forced to distance ourselves. I found this both ironic and tragic. At this time, the hardest thing to keep alive is our sense of self.\n\n This game is not intended to be played for long. Perhaps it isnât a game at all.  It is a space for your thoughts and reflections. You can use it how you like.  I hope you have a great Game Jam.",

Training will increase your pets work speed (hidden) however it really doesn\u0027t like training!\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n![V1-0 gameplay.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b664.png)\n\n![V1-0 tutorial.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b666.png)\n\n![StartScreen.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b667.png)\n\n*This game was made for Ludum Dare 46 Compo, a 48 hour solo Game Jam.*\n\nThe game was developed from scratch in an empty Unity project.

You have to personally choose which crops to grow and sell to merchants in exchange for gold coins to save the farm. Some crops have short planting time and low yield, and some grow for a long time with high yields. Water and fertilizer in the soil decrease over time, and you need gold coins in exchange for water and fertilizer. How to bring the farm back to life, it\u0027s all about your choices. By the way, the crop will wither if you don\u0027t log on to the game for a long time.\n### About Us\nThis is the first time my friend tww and I have participated in LD together. The size of the game is small. There was no way out. There were only two of us, and neither of us could do art. By the way it\u0027s a very exciting 72-hour way to make a game, It makes us less likely to procrastinate. We will continue to do more fun games in the future, we hope you support a lot.

Hope you enjoy!\n\nAll code, sprites and sounds were created by me.\nFont used is Arch Rival and can be found here:  https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/SF-Arch-Rival\n\n## Description\n\nBaby is an egg. For some reason, your species gives birth in the middle of space. It\u0027s pretty dangerous out there. You need to protect baby until it grows up and can fend for itself. Keep it alive!\n![screensho1.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b523.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n[A] and [D] - rotate your ship around the egg\n\n[J] - fire bullets\n\n[L] - grab the nearest item, when it is fully charged\n\n\n## Gameplay\n\nHealth - This is the health of you and Baby combined. Don\u0027t let it drop to zero or you will lose.\n\nGrab - When this bar is full you can pull the closest item towards you to give it to Baby.\n\nGrowth - You win when this timer is full.\n\n\nBaby will randomly get bored, hungry or thirsty. Getting it the correct item will boost the growth bar, but providing the wrong item will decrease it!\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b525.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b527.png)\n\n## Tips\n\nYou can destroy items you don\u0027t want by shooting them. Remember, you can only grab the item closest to you.",

In one moment I was really close to stop my LD jam. But then I found this fantastic platformer mechanic which make my platformer totally epic. I know this mechanic has more potential then I put into my levels but I dont want to create hard unplayable game, like I did last time :). Pls let me know what you think about this game mechanic, did you saw that in any game?\n\nIn this game you are jinxed to have your heart outside of your body and you must take care about it. Keep it alive to the finish flag, thats it.\n\nControls:\n-horizontal movement \n\n-up arrow to jump! \n\n-space to speed up the cycle\n\n\nfollow my twitter https://twitter.com/OneGuystruggle\n\n\nUsed agme engine UNITY, audio recorded in Audacity, \"art\" in paint.net\n\nif you find a heartbreaking bug or you are not able to run the game pls let me know in the comment section\n\n\n",

        "body":  "Hi, this is my entry for LD46 \"Keep it alive\"!\n\nIn this game you have an aquarium and start with 2 fish. Your job is to keep your fish healthy and alive so they can populate. For that you can give your fish food, a cleaning or repair the oxygen pump! You also can reset the cooldowns, because the more fish you have, the more they need their needs.\n\nControls are fairly simple, click on the icons in the top left to apply one of the effects. The pump has to additionially be clicked with the wrench! \n\nF - fast reset the first cooldown that needs a reset (from left to right)  \nALT - show debug information (some data about fish and pump)  \nM - to unmute/mute music\n\nThe game is over, when you don\u0027t have any fishes anymore.\nAll assets and code have been made by myself, but this time with no sound effects from myself because I thought it would be weird when the fishy sounds everytime something happens.\n\nThanks for reading and playing, if you leave a comment I will definitely check out your game aswell!\n\n![bestgif.gif](///raw/3cd/e/z/2b4d1.gif)",

Secondly, there are three difficulties in the game. You can make your own choice. There are three props in the game: stopping all enemies, enlarging the sphere, and letting all enemies lose a drop of blood. There are two kinds of enemies in the game: ordinary enemies and sprint enemies\n\n\nSince I donât know art, I used game asset on the Internet, so I had to develop the Jam team.

Questions about that? :)\n\n### Objective\nThe objective is to protect your egg (your baby) as long as you possibly can.\n\n### How to play\n* Control the chicken with the ARROW-keys, the WASD-keys or your mouse (only horizontal).\n* Shoot with the SPACE BAR-key or the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.\n* Use the MINIMAP, it\u0027s a great tool to keep track of the enemies.\n* Pick upp ammo on the ground, they will increase your weapon damage.\n\n### Enemies\nEnemies have different amount of health. A few things to notice:\n* The girl has very little health but she is very fast.\n* The police has heavy armor and can therefore take a lot of damage.\n* The longer you survive, the quicker will enemies spawn.\n\n![06b.gif](///raw/159/f2/z/2bb54.gif)\n\n### Version history\n\n#### Version 2\n* Added minimap to help keep track of enemies. Each enemy has a unique minimap icon.\n* Added so targets have a chance to drop bullets when they die. Picking up bullets increase your damage.\n\n#### Version 1\n* Initial release\n\n### Feedback\nThank you for taking time to check out my game. Please don\u0027t forget to leave feedback :)",

Instead of a pet, you must keep an adventurer alive while she fights monsters and collects loot.\n\nThe adventurer performs actions herself. As she adventures she will gain gold, which the player can use. However performing actions deplete her resources: HP and hunger. If either resource is completely depleted the adventurer will die â .\n\nYou can replenish her resources by spending gold to play a timed mini-game. You replenish more resources the better you perform in the mini-game.\n\n## Controls\n\n|          | Movement | Action |\n| -------- | -------- | ------- |\n| Keyboard | WASD     | Spacebar |\n| Gamepad  | Left Joystick | A |\n\n![ld46_ss2.png](///raw/873/3/z/2b866.png)\n\n## Tools\n\nEverything was made using the [Pixelbox.js](https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox) game engine.",

The concept is to stay alive as long as you can by spreading the blob to adjacent land tiles. Each tile costs energy to consume, but gives energy back over time from the resources it devours.\n\n## About The Developer\n\n**Giant Blobs From Mars** was developed for Ludum Dare 46 by **Billy McDaniel** under the name of **Almighty Games**. I am known for publishing games on Steam, teaching video game development on Udemy and streaming game design on Twitch. I am currently building an expansive collection of low-poly 3D environment assets which will appear in many of the online marketplaces very soon.\n\nIt\u0027s probably worth mentioning that I am also an accomplished musician and performed and recorded the music tracks for this game as well. The recordings are all first draft, very quick improvisation with all of the slurs and imperfections left in place.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot 2.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd6.png)\n\n![screenshot 4.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd9.png)\n\n",

Those pesky ants want to destroy your hive and eat all the honey you have produced. You control an assembly of bees, and your goal is a simple one: ***to protect your Queen.*** By defeating ants you render the bee Queen safe and simultaneously *keep it alive*.\n![ss5.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08b.png)\nAbout the game\n====\nChoose from several types of bee units and actions and try to stop swarms of ants from reaching your Queen bee. The game is turn based and requires you to build a simplified economy model in order to provide necessary currency to buy lines of defense. \nSince the game was created solely for Ludum Dare 46 its content is restricted. Nonetheless the player may choose from four units, each having different abilities in order to stop unrelenting hordes of ants. Currently ant enemies come in two variants, differing in health points. \n\nSince there is no tutorial, please refer to the following guide:\n\n*During your turn you can place new units as well as order attacks.\n*During enemy turn the ants move towards the Queen and if they have already encountered a bee, they attack it. The Counterattack of bees is automatic. Beware though, collectors are vulnerable and defenseless!\n*At the beginning of own turn collectors generate honey which acts the in-game currency.\n*You lose if an ant reaches the queen.\n* You win if you survive all waves of enemies.\nEvery wave there are more of enemies and tougher ants are more common.\nPlayable bees:\n\n* collector - a simple drone that has a 50% of generating an unit of honey at the beginning of each turn,\n* beeguard - a powerful defensive unit capable of holding and tackling even toughest enemies,\n* strike unit - a one-use only order to sting a chosen enemy for 1 point of damage,\n* trike team - a devastative attack launched at an enemy of your choosing for 3 damage.\n![ss6.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08c.png)\nAbout author\n====\nThe game was created in Unity and Photoshop by me, Ian Burr, an owner of YouTube channel focused on teaching game development and programming.\n",

After graduating from undergraduate, I went directly to your school to study doctorate. The normal graduation period is 5 years, and it may be postponed up to 8 years.\n\nYou can see my graduation requirements and my current status. Every turn, I have 7 initial points of energy and different things I can do according to my status. When the energy is not enough, you can click the âNext turnâ button to refresh.\n\nI\u0027ll trouble you in the next five years. Pay more attention to my attributes. If there are 3 items that are too low, I will be in danger. It doesnât matter if I graduate or not, please keep me alive.",

        "body":  "\n\n[The website will self-destruct](https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com) if you don\u0027t engage with it.\n\nIt\u0027s been a rough month for me, and I\u0027m sure it has for a lot of people.  So I figured, lets create a nice cozy place online where you can write about the issues you\u0027re having.\n\nPlease feel free to read some of the messages that have been left so far, and send one yourself.\n\n--\n\nA little more information about the thought process behind making this, and some of the process after the initial release.\n\nI acknowledge this is about as little of a \u0027game\u0027 as it can come.  \n\nI\u0027d initially come up with the self-destructive website that requires interaction.  Then I was imagining how we could turn that into a game.  My first thought was that this reminds me of something like entering the numbers in Lost, but is more interactive.\n\nI was thinking through interesting things people could do to interact with it.  I\u0027d love to do something that requires getting to a particular location, or performing some tasks.  First I was thinking the system could verify these via an API, but anything interesting that was gamey seemed to go against social distancing guidelines.\n\nThen, I was considering something closer to the Taskmaster #hometasking tasks.  If you\u0027re not aware, there have been tasks every day or two where you have between 5 and 30 hours to complete some task, and take a 20 second video of it.  It\u0027s been a really positive, joyful thing to watch a ton of 20 second clips of people performing silly, funny, entertaining tasks like \u0027turn your bathroom into a fun place to hangout.\u0027\n\nBut after some reflection, they\u0027ve got that covered.  And I encourage you to check it out.\n\nWhat I realized the best thing I could do with the idea, even if it might make it seem less like a game, is to encourage people to write openly and honestly about their lives in a completely ephemeral space.\n\nHonestly, that was my theory, but I wasn\u0027t sure how well people would respond to it, but the responses have been amazing.  I\u0027ve read stories that have been heartbreaking, encouraging, kind, compassionate, and hilarious.  Some people just want to give the website a bit of love, but many many more than I ever could have expected have used it to share something honest.\n\n--\n\nA couple of developer notes and design decisions:\n\nThe Heart button really does record hearts/likes, but this is just kept on the backend.  I\u0027d considered exposing that data, but I don\u0027t think encouraging any kind of \u0027like-hunting\u0027 behavior is necessarily what I\u0027m going for here.  I just want an outlet for sending positivity.  And I think that a broken button doesn\u0027t feel as honest as a real button that\u0027s really doing something.\n\nThe self-destruction mechanism works by checking every page-load that it hasn\u0027t been 24 hours since the last post.  If it has, it immediately deletes all the records in the database.  The counter at the top of the page reflects the real time remaining, and is updated every 90 seconds, so it\u0027ll tick back up after someone posts a new letter.\n\nInitially, I\u0027d planned on only letting you \u0027Read a message\u0027 after sending a message, but shorty after I started testing I realized that it was nice to come back and read a message later.  I could have kept a cookie on someone\u0027s computer, but that felt more invasive than this should be. \n\nI\u0027ve had to build a small moderation tool, since about 5% of the responses are generally hurtful.  I\u0027m not filtering via word choice, since I think it\u0027s reasonable to want to use expletives right now.  Instead, I\u0027m manually reviewing the messages as they come in.\n\nThanks so much for reading.",
