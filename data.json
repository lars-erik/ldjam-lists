You\u0027ll need it if you want to win.\n(watch your water, it will run out; if you do, put it back in your bucket with the same process to \"dunk\" it back in.\nThis recharges your mop and the UI will reflect the new store of water.\n\nYour Cart will run over people and kill them. Just click the left mouse button again to give it a little kick.\n\nyou navigate around the place.\n\nvictory will be assured if you get the girl thing to her ship, that\u0027s on a countdown so you have to survive till it runs out, at the end.\n\ngood luck.\n\nnote:Click ESC at anytime to access the menu, mute sounds, and change every control, but one. I was unable to have the time to map the grabCart button. The rest are mapped and can be changed to anything.\n",

I hope I can still post it to the compo as I had completed and posted a post in the timeframe allotted and have not changed anything at all in the game sense.-\n\n\nYou start in a procedurally generated map full of trees, bushes, grass, rocks, and non-edible mushrooms (not morel). In the middle at the start is a small morel mushroom. You are to defend this mushroom from other mushroom pickers!\n\nYou must go around the map while keeping an eye on your growing baby morel mushroom. Pick other mushrooms and collect them. When you see an incoming mushroom picker you must use these picked mushrooms as \"Ammo\" to rid of the other mushroom pickers. Each hour the baby morel grows just a bit bigger. Each day attracts more pickers who want to steal your mushroom. If it gets to be too much for you. You can pick your mushroom at any time.\n ",

But the game itself I finished an hour before the dealine, so I am going for Compo. I finished a day earlier this second round, allow me to celebrate. Feel free to evaluate as you please.\n\nI will a upload a separate link as if for Jam. \nI would like to work on music, polish, and game balance.\n\nBut first I need some dedess sleep\n\nv1.0 (Compo Version, Buggy, Broken)\n\n\nI will upload the Source Code soon.\n\n![fun.png](///raw/1a6/32/z/2cfae.png)\n\n- How to Play\n\nThe game can be cryptic. I tried to put in as much tutorial as I can, but it is still quite hectic. \nThe objective is to stop the spread of the Crimp disease within the town. \nWhen a house catches the Crimp the HP bar shows up. You can mix to make ingredients\n\nIMPORTANT \n- U and O to scroll through the Slots. You cannot use weapons and get items in a filled slot. You MUST scroll. I\u0027m sorry for this bizzarre game mechanics but on the other hand I got quite used to it.\n\n- R to Remove Slot.\n\n- E to Select: add ingredient to Cauldroun, try and give medicine to house\n- Q to Cancel\n- Tab for Recipe\n\n- The rest of the keys are within the hints in the upper right corner. \n\n- The goal is to create the Panacea and... then it\u0027s a secret I guess.\n\nAlso this needed a lot of playtesting to get it right and I just didn\u0027t have the time. \n",

I tell ya man, the world is harsh.\n\nSo it\u0027s up to you, keep Mr Buzz alive!!!\n\nUses only a mouse... haven\u0027t tried with a trackpad yet, but the mouse is almost certainly WAY better :)\n\nNew builds coming pronto! (Mac? Web? Will see...)\n\n![OpeningScreen.jpg](///raw/eff/8/z/2cece.jpg)\n\n![RandomShot1.jpg](///raw/eff/8/z/2cebf.jpg)\n\n![RandomShot2.jpg](///raw/eff/8/z/2cec8.jpg)\n\n![RandomShot3.jpg](///raw/eff/8/z/2cec9.jpg)\n\n![RandomShot4.jpg](///raw/eff/8/z/2cf4a.jpg)\n\nThis was a solo effort, everything from scratch.  Sounds were entirely me and a microphone and audacity.  I adore doing sounds for these events, but have to say time got away from me and I have several other funny audio things I just didn\u0027t have time to script, BUT... I\u0027m really happy with how this plays.\n\nSome cool design notes:\n\nIt\u0027s ***SUPER*** imporant to remember that your score is the LOWEST of your four scores.  Pick your nibbles wisely! :)\n\nIf you yank the mouse quickly too far, the fly takes flight, which makes you invulnerable for a second or two, but you miss out on valuable eating time.\n\nSimilarly, if you \"run into\" an attacking arm/swatter on the table after it hits, you\u0027ll also take flight, again, losing eating time.\n\nI give you a slight delay before impacts will kill you, to keep it fun.\n\nOh, and eating speed ramps up over a few seconds, so it\u0027s beneficial once you start eating to stay still as the rate increases.\n\nThat\u0027s about it! Hope you have fun!",

This task was made difficult, however, by the fact that if I didn\u0027t make it back in time, that rager would not be raging much longer, and even more difficult because of the poor gas mileage on my dinky dinker.\n\nAnyways, this game is my story.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-04-19 at 8.18.12 PM.png](///raw/bdc/d2/z/2cec1.png)\n\nCheck out my other games on [my website](cjlane.tech).\n\nArt and fonts from Kenney.nl and Chrisblue (https://opengameart.org/content/type7r-spritefont), music from Johan Brodd (https://opengameart.org/content/metropolis-rush)",

Will you spend your money on health potions? Buff the Hero with a magic shield? How many waves can you KEEP YE ALIVE?!\n![ld46-screenshot.jpg](///raw/4dd/03/z/2cf31.jpg)\n## Compo++\n- I worked alone on this. The artwork, sound effects, music, and code are all mine and fresh as of the last couple dozen hours. I _am_ using PIXIJS and a lightweight boilerplate that I created to start from - other than that and minor use of GSAP the rest is vanilla JS... erm... TS.\n- Fair warning this game is hardly done needs some work and I\u0027ll likely keep pushing but I had a blast trying to get something cranked out in 24 hours (I didn\u0027t get to start until 9PM yesterday). Pink head is a placeholder... just couldn\u0027t use the plain pink box on its own.  :laughing: Ugh... yeah and it hasn\u0027t been optimized or preloaded :rolling_eyes: \n- Sorry, so far there is only the one health potion (cost 1 coin). There are meant to be a number of enemies and waves and what not... but yeah... time is a thing.\n## How to Play\n* The game plays itself. The hero will fight the baddies and if he lands his sword swing he\u0027ll take them out. Otherwise he may take some damage.\n* You are in charge of buying potions for the hero to keep it alive.\n* Click a potion to purchase it and the hero will immediately drink it.\n* With a little luck and planning your game will las more than a few seconds.\n\n",

There\u0027s a one-minute tutorial it and works on mobile web or on your computer.  Contains over 10,000 unique words.\n\nNotes: It was fun making a quick, simple game for my first jam.  I only had a few hours today (Sunday) to throw this together, but I hope you get some enjoyment out of playing it for a few minutes or so.  Thanks for checking it out.!\n\n[Mobile](///raw/7fd/03/z/2cffd.png)",

For mouse and keyboard.\n\n### Play here:\nhttp://planktongames.com/blob\n\n![SS0.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2cde4.jpg)\n\n## Premise:\nYou are a mad scientist who loves growing blobs. Unfortunately, your blobs have been getting infected recently.\n\nYour goal is to create full 5x5 blocks of healthy blobs. If you do, these blocks are immune from disease.\n\n## Controls and Instructions:\n- You get your blobs in irregular groups of five at a time\n- To place a group on empty spots, **Click** on the grid\n- You can rotate the group with the **E** and **R** keys\n- If you leave a hole when you place a group, it will fill in with an infected blob\n- There are two levels of blob infection, infected (spotty) and diseased (purple)\n- You can heal a 3x3 square of blobs with medicine. Move your mouse to the center of the area you want to heal and hit the **M** key. Infected blobs become healthy, and diseased blobs become merely infected.\n- If you surround a medical syringe on the board with blobs, you collect it and can use it.\n- The Infection bar rises over time (after the first level). If the Infection bar fills, some healthy blobs on the board will be infected, and some infected or diseased blobs will infect their neighbors. \n- If you get stuck, or if your blob gets too infected, hit **ESC** to restart the level or return to the main menu\n\n## Creation\nWritten in HTML5/JavaScript using the CraftyJS library. Art in GIMP and PowerPoint with word graphics from CoolText.com. Sounds in GoldWave Audio. Music created in WolframTones composition tool.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Gameplay\n![SS0.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2cde4.jpg)\n\n### Level intro\n![SS1.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2cdec.jpg)\n\n### Help screen\n![SS3.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2cdf0.jpg)",

Otherwise, it chooses the largest resolution out of (1920x1080), (1280x720), (640, 360) that is 90% of your screen or less.  That means that screen sizes close to 1280x720 but not exactly are kind of screwed.

        "body":  "Resource management/economic simulation game developed in the pixel art style. The goal is to water your money trees until they get mature enough to begin producing money. You can use the money to buy water from the in-game shop. Be alert -- some deals are better than others; there is a dynamic pricing mechanism to the shop requiring players to think carefully before they buy. Additionally, money harvested from the trees is dynamically calculated as well. This adds for extra difficulty and no two games playing alike!!\n\n![Live for Money gif2.gif](///raw/a87/d2/z/2cd06.gif)\n\n![Live for Money gif1.gif](///raw/a87/d2/z/2cd04.gif)\n\n[Live for Money - Achievement System.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccec.png)\n\n![Live for Money - Dynamic Shop System 1.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccf1.png)\n\n![Live for Money - Dynamic Treegrowth based on individual 16bit tiles.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccf3.png)![Live for Money - Main Menu.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccf6.png)\n\n![Live for Money - Money Tree Base Scene.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccf8.png)![Live for Money - Money Tree Ready for Harvest.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccfa.png)\n\n![Live for Money - Water Collection Scene.png](///raw/a87/d2/z/2ccfc.png)",

Actually i couldn\u0027t manage the scope of the game, i wasted tons of time and.. so this is not a complete game but playable. I couldn\u0027t implement opening screen, musics, sfxs and source code is a completely mess. Maybe later i make a more polished and balanced afterjam version.\n\n## HOW TO PLAY\n\n![ld46_4.gif](///raw/39b/71/z/2cedd.gif)\n\nYou are starting as a scout war pilot who had crashed into the jungle where near to enemy camp. Your main target is repairing the rf transmitter(the green thing that near to crash site) to send a zero code to get help and keep yourself alive. To fix the device, you have to find some parts by searching the near enemy camp buildings.\n\n![ld46_6.gif](///raw/39b/71/z/2cef6.gif)\n\n### Keys\n\nArrow keys to aim and move\n\nX to shoot and interact with environment\n\nZ to open the inventory",

All that is left to do is to keep feeding the darkness by punching in the runes to the right beat!\n\nYou\u0027ll need a keyboard with a spacebar and a few letters :) Just tap when the rune is on top of the corresponding letter.\n\n----\n\nThis is my first game experiment with Godot. I enjoyed using it quite a bit!\n\nBuilds for Windows and Linux should work well. MacOS untested. Also couldn\u0027t get the HTML5 version working properly.",

Unfortunately for you it grew to a massive size right out of little shop of horrors and it is hungry for more than sunlight. So grab your trusty fishing pole and steal food from pedestrians on the street! Keep the monstrosity well fed until the day runs out and you will be just fine. If not then the plant will eat whatever it can to stay alive. That means you. You\u0027re gonna get eaten.![cap3.PNG](///raw/964/52/z/2cf92.png)\n# Controls\n### Wind back fishing pole - Hold Left Mouse Button\n### Cast fishing pole - Release Left Mouse Button\n### Reel in - Hold space bar\n### Feed the plant - Turn around towards the plant and press spacebar\n## READ THE CONTROLS ESPECIALLY PART ABOUT HOW TO FEED THE PLANT. MAKE SURE YOU ARE FACING IT! \n# Lose Condition\n### If the plant is not fed for a long enough period of time it will eat you and you lose. You can tell how fed the plant is by how close it is.\n# Win Condition\n### Keep the plant fed for a long enough time, did not have a way to track this due to time constraints :/\n# What I didn\u0027t get to add\nI was in the process of making a detection system in which the pedestrians would get upset about their food getting stolen and harass you, chasing away any other pedestrians who may be walking by. The work around for this was going to be hiding. Unfortunately I had to scrap it for time.\n# Post Mortem\nOverall I am happy with how it turned out. All in all I don\u0027t like this game as much as my game for the last jam (Ooze for the Ooze Gods). The plus side is that shader effects and 3D models for assets is a TON quicker and easier than shaders and pixel art in Game Maker Studio (which I am used to). But there are a lot more holes to get lost down with unity. Rotations are always screwy, Colliders and meshes are things I always spend tons of time tweaking. Debugging Unity is a bunch more time consuming (for me so I could just be bad lmao). ![cap4.PNG](///raw/964/52/z/2cf94.png)",

        "body":  "Club Ludum is a real time battle game where you try to keep the party alive by hype-ing and recruiting background dancers from the dancefloor using your secret DJ techniques.\n\n===========================================================\n\nMade in 48-hours from the Ludum Dare Compo by Jordi Tudela Alcacer using:\n- Unity 2019.3.7f1 Personal\n- Photoshop\n- Audition\n- Bosca Ceoil\n\n===========================================================\n\n# Controls\n\nWhen the ATB is full (as indicated by the yellow lamp) you can perform a secret DJ technique:\n- [Q] [A]: Use a basic technique (slightly inrease hype on 1 dancer)\n- [W] [Z]: Use a first tier technique and consume 1 bar of Music Power (as indicated by the blue lamp).\n- [E]:     Use a second tier technique and consume 2 bars of Music Power (as indicated by the blue lamp).\n- [R]:     Use the ultimate technique and consume 4 bars of Music Power (as indicated by the blue lamp).\n\n**The techniques depend on the music style**\n\nOther controls:\n\n- [1] / [4]: change the music style.\n- [left arrow] / [right arrow]: Change the target\n- [H]: display the help panel with aditional information (it also slows time)\n- [M]: go back to the main menu\n\n\n# Directions\n\n- You *LOSE* when the last background dancer leaves. \n- The background dancers will leave from time to time.\n- You need to recruit dancers by hype-ing them up (hypemeter full).\n- New dancers keep comming regularly (you can see them through the back windows). They will take a spot on the dancefloor if there\u0027s room available. If there\u0027s no available spots, they will go somewhere else (without penalty).\n- Dancers on the showfloor are bad mannered and they will use nasty moves to increase their boredoom.\n- If a dancer becomes bored (snoozemeter is full), they will leave (and you won\u0027t be able to recruit them).\n- You *WIN* when the morning comes (ie. there are no new arrivals - after about 16 people)\n- When the prefered music style of a dancer is playing, they will become entranced. Entranced dancers don\u0027t use any moves when their ATB gets full but any moves against them are inneffective.\n\n# Your techniques\n\nDisco:\n- [W] [Z]: the target becomes more susceptible to get hyped (next hype action against them gets +1).\n- [E]:     1 hype to everyone.\n- [R]:     Every dancer becomes a Disco fan.\n\nFunk:\n- [W] [Z]: Extra hype to the target (ie. +2 hype to them).\n- [E]:     Slightly removes boredom from everyone.\n- [R]:     Removes all the target\u0027s boredom.\n\nRock:\n- [W] [Z]: Changes the target\u0027s next action to tantrum (+1 boredom to self)\n- [E]:     Stuns the target for 2 turns. A stunned target won\u0027t attack.\n- [R]:     Stuns everyone for a turn.\n\n# Dancer actions\n\n- Tantrum (!) increses boredom by 1 to self / the dancer on the left / the dancer on the right / all dancers.\n- Singing (musical note): makes a dancer more susceptible to boredom for 2 turns (next bore action aganst them will recieve +1).\n- Spill the drink (the martini glass): all dancers are inmune to hype for a round.\n- Puke (the blob): Someone gets their hype back to 0\n\n*tip: Lilac Rocker only uses tantrums. Disco Steve is the one who uses the more advanced tricks.*\n\n\n============================================================\n\n# SCREENSHOTS\n\n![ClubLudum_1.jpg](///raw/ec5/3/z/2cc8e.jpg)\n\n============================================================\n\n# COMMENTS\n\n- For AZERTY users, even though it doesn\u0027t appear in the UI, [A] will also trigger the technique labeled as [Q] and [Z] will also trigger [W]. \n\n\n============================================================\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n\n\n===========================================================\n\n# Contact\n[twitter.com/bar0net](http://twitter.com/bar0net) \n",

        "body":  "If you have no interest in my musings, go to **What is it and how to play**\n\nOh boy... was this LD something else.\n\n![ss1.png](///raw/416/z/2ce6e.png)\n\nYou know what\u0027s the best idea one can get? Well, I don\u0027t either, but I\u0027d say making Darkest Dungeon from scratch for LD compo is not one of them. \n\nSo I\u0027ve coded a whole lot of damn mechanics. There\u0027s various types of enemies. I drew three versions. They have several different abilities. Healers, archers, buffers, the whole lot. Limiter for skills usable from only certain positions works. There\u0027s a checkpoint system that could be extended into game saving in a few lines of code. There\u0027s a skill progression system, where you can improve your abilities in exchange for the \"demon essence\" (the resource you get from fallen enemies, or when you find them on your path). And that\u0027s about the third of what I wanted to make.\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/416/z/2ce8c.png)\n\n48 hours is apparently just enough time to create a system, but not to make a game in it. Maybe if I havent spent about 45 minutes - hour creating a \"shield\" prop and reference photos, which I couldn\u0027t use anyway (I drew everything from scratch in the end), there would be a more meaningful gameplay. What you\u0027ll play here is basically just the bare combat system. \n\nThe strange thing is I feel no frustration. The compo version is fun to tinker around with, and looking at the game in motion makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\n![ss4.png](///raw/416/z/2ce73.png)\nI ended at 3:15, because I was trying to exterminate the last few bugs that made the game unplayable. The compo version is still fragile, and probably easily crashable (IDK, I didn\u0027t have time to test it), but at least it sorta works. \n\nI spent 38-40 of last 48 hours making this jewel, so there\u0027ll be a post compo version with all the stuff the rules prohibit me from adding now. Check back later if you\u0027re interested. \n\n**What is it and how to play**\n\nThis is a side scrolling game with a turn-based combat.\n\nThe movement is automatic. You only control combat in compo version. \n![ss3.png](///raw/416/z/2ce7f.png)\nHover over your enemies or allies to see the list of possible actions. Click the ability button to use that ability. You can see the order of character turns on the bottom of the screen during combat. Hovering over the icons on the bottom of the screen will show you which character the particular icon represents(with redish arrow), and if it represents an enemy, it will show you which position will that enemy attack this turn. \n\n\nThere\u0027s something slightly wrong with the web-build. If you have the time/patience, please download the windows version. It\u0027s so much more fluid, pretty, and everything.\n",

This is the perfect time to make a sourdough starter and bake your own bread. So get your hands dirty and make a yeast culture like your ancestors used to make. You couldn\u0027t just buy prepared yeast in the middle ages.\n\nHow to play:\n\n* Mix flour and water to give yeast an environment in which it can thrive and multiply.\n* Click on the clock to advance time until the next day. But careful, the yeast will generate air bubbles. We don\u0027t want to make a mess!\n* Shake the container to help remove air bubbles from the mix.\n* That\u0027s it, it a very simple and stupid game :)\n\nYou can find the source in the following link: https://github.com/Edearth/ld46-sourdough-starter-kit",

Just be sure to avoid getting hit, because that knocks your flame away and severs the connection. The flame is extremely fragile and can die in a single hit from such powerful attacks, and you\u0027re not much better off, so try to avoid danger as much as possible.\n\nThe enemy is not very persistent however, and will give up after only a minute of hunting as they really don\u0027t care if you\u0027re alive or dead at the end of the day.

        "body":  "[logo.png](///raw/ae9/d2/z/2cc16.png)\nThank you for contracting with Cupid\u0027s Arrow Inc.â¢ Difficult Cases Division. This division strives to keep successfully matched couples, that might be having a few difficulties, together. We work very hard to keep our matching success rate high and cases like these really challenge our excellence. \n\nSomehow, these two, horrible individuals got through the matching process and we need you to keep the relationship alive. At least until they\u0027re married and we aren\u0027t liable for their relationship anymore. Good luck and don\u0027t fail.\n\nThe game is turn based and you will have to use repair cards to remove the bad cards that the clients will play each round. These repair cards must be used to fix bad cards until those cards are fully repaired and are discarded. Each bad card that is repaired will grant you 1.5 cards for next round; repair 2 bad cards and receive 3 repair cards next round.",

This must be refreshed everytime items are messe with.\n - Transaction - I learned how to save data in the form of transactions, so that instead of having to calculate for example how much cached is being produced, that value is automatically updated with each transaction / scene refresh rathen than being done every frame.\n\n## Next Steps\n - Animations - I actually created some very basic animations for the items, just didn\u0027t have the time to put them in.\n - Dialogue - I will add more dialogue every now and then to make the game more engaging\n - Sounds - Printer don\u0027t go Brr cuz there is no sound!! I will add them in the upcoming days\n - Bug Fixing - I only realised that you can purchase all the upgrades for free after submitting the game ð\u0085\n\n## Tools Used\n- Unity\n- Photoshop - for the amazing art\n- Ilustrator - to trace some images online\n- OBS - to record the whole process and make a timelapse later!\n- Microsoft Visual Studio - code editor\n\n\n## Changelog\n v0.01 - Fixed manual, hiding behind the UI\n",

Stay Home simulates a small piece of a city with 40,000 inhabitants and a population density similar to a reasonably dense city. During the \"game\" you can adjust the degree to which the city is locked down and the extent to which the inhabitants wear masks. You will be able to see the effects of this on the spread of the illness as well as the number of fatalities. \n\nHow To Play:\n\n* You have to keep people alive for 15 \"days\".\n* You can adjust the fraction of people staying indoors and wearing masks.\n* The statistics about healthy / sick / recovered people are shown in a plot that appears across the map.\n* The number of people in different apartments in a building are shown with colored squares. The color indicates whether the inhabitants are sick, recovered, or healthy.\n\nGifs:\n\n[First](https://imgur.com/sO5U0Qk)\n\n[Second](https://imgur.com/tWipQLS)\n\nScreenshots:\n\n![LD46 4_19_2020 6_45_08 PM.png](///raw/341/41/z/2cdf6.png)\n\n![LD46 4_19_2020 6_48_45 PM.png](///raw/341/41/z/2ce07.png)\n\n![LD46 4_19_2020 6_49_36 PM.png](///raw/341/41/z/2ce13.png)\n\nWarning: It should go without saying, but I made this in 48 hours and this should not be taken to be an accurate simulation of anything.\n\nPatch Notes:\n\n\n",

Every 1.5 minutes you are granted the chance for an additional power to help feed the spirit. Try to keep it alive as long as possible by feeding as many letters as possible, or score maximum points by feeding it the largest words.\n\nEach time a tile is used in a word, it loses 1 durability (the number in the corner). When that reaches 0, the tile is randomized.\n\nYou start with a King\u0027s movement (Only adjacent tiles) and the reset power (which reduces all tile durability by 2). The big blue button is used to submit a word (green arrow = ok, red circle = not a word or already used before).\n\n![ld_word_game.png](///raw/1db/31/z/2cc04.png)",

So many hours lost to obscure collision problems, leaving me so CLOSE to being able to execute on the more fun aspects of the game idea that the foundation was necessary to support.\n\nSadly in the end, there\u0027s not a lot of \"Game\" here compared to my usual entries. Originally you were supposed to reach an eventual goal, but instead you just see how far you can get across an endless desert.\n\nThat said I think it proves the potential of its concept! I was dying to add local multiplayer and lots of fun things to discover in the desert! And the foundation is there to support those things but as standard, there just wasn\u0027t the time. Too much ambition in this one, I\u0027m sure I will learn nothing from this mistake.\n\nEnjoy and feel free to comment with what sort of things you think would be cool to see out in the desert.\n\nIn the absence of any sound or music feel free to enjoy the following music as you play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7r9W6fsX98\n\n",

Enemies arrive in the west. They will avoid going through towers unless you leave them no other choice.\n\nT =\u003e Build Laser Turret\n\nLaser turrets are your basic turret and cost 25 credits. They shoot fast, but don\u0027t do much damage.\n\nE =\u003e Build Energy Turret\n\nEnergy turrets are your AOE turret and cost 200 credits. They shoot slow moving projectiles\nthat damage all enemies around the target when they land.\n\nM =\u003e Build Magnet Turret\n\nMagnet turrets slow enemies that pass by them down.\n\nU =\u003e Upgrade turrets\n\nUpgrade a turret. Upgrades cost 2x base cost for level 2, 3x base cost for level 3\n\n## Post-deadline fix\n\nNote: In the initially publushed build the magnet turret was not working due to a bug registering colliders.

This game doesn\u0027t have sounds, sorry. \n\nIf you reach a brightly lighted room : gg, you\u0027re supposed to get an end screen... but you won\u0027t because of some unknown reason. For an other unknown reason you sometime get stuck in the wall or the ground : again, very sorry.\n\nNow that this has been said : you wake up next to a cylinder, in what looks like a lab, suddenly you get attacked and die... only to see your spirit wakes and take control of the murderer ! Flee you mad... green... spirity-thingy ! Flee to keep the hope of being the character of a good game alive !\n\n(the cover image is from the level as seen from Blender, before Unity did what I can only describe as \"something the Geneva Convention should have banned\", it\u0027s technically not \"in the game\" per say but hey, I made it, it\u0027s probably the only thing about this that I\u0027m proud of so I\u0027m using it !)",

If you find a way to route your water off the edge of the map the game will crash. There is also a bug with water pressure not working correctly in certain situations. I\u0027m sure there are also other bugs.

        "body":  "Well, expecting to not finish as usual, I took it way too easy this time around.\n\nAfter a number of hours wasted fighting to get some things working, and another hour trying to get VS2017 to help package the Unreal project... it is woefully incomplete. (Not to mention the hours spent just hanging out with friends, but that\u0027s more user error than mistake.)\n\nI\u0027m pretty happy with where it was headed, and hope to finish it sometime in the near future. It got VERY ugly towards the end there, and the game SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED.\n\nI\u0027m going ahead with uploading it, because it\u0027s the first time I was at least heading somewhere I was happy during a LD. Seriously, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING THIS.\n\nFor a solo effort, in the 48 hours, I\u0027m alright with this as a new starting point.\n\nThe game does not have a menu, posted controls, explanation, sound, music, polish, a win condition, a loss condition, or... really anything that makes you think \"hey, this is technically a video game!\"\n\nWhat it does have, is - technically it runs.\n\nBasically, you\u0027re a water sprite, on an island, you start next to a lake.\nTrees on the island will spawn fairies, which will accumulate on the lake.\nYou can gather them, as mana.\nYou can then spend that mana to douse fires.\nFires?\nOh yeah, the game will spawn meteors, which will impact the island, and spread fire sprites, which will burn down the trees, spawning more fire sprites.\nThe goal? Keep it alive, of course! (Not supported.)\n\nControls:\nWASD will move you.\nSpacebar will jump you.\nIf you have mana, (Only indicated by your watery size right now.) the left mouse button will douse flames/trees.\nThe right click will absorb fairies on the lake, in a cone in front of you. (Not indicated at all.)\nEscape should terminate the program. (Tip: By not downloading, you can skip to this part.)\n\nI hope everybody had fun participating this time around, I know it kept me busy. I\u0027m limiting myself to the compo times, just as practice.\n\n-Lem",

You are the last line of defence in keeping the human race alive!\nThe gameplay is designed to be fast paced and chaotic as you scramble around to try and keep the inhabitants of your ship alive while staying alive yourself.\n\nThis was my first time competing in a game jam, I decided to do this extremely last minute and it was extremely frantic but I had a blast making this game. I definitely made the mistake of biting off more than I can chew, and had to cut many features last minute, however I feel that the final product is a lot of fun to play and quite challenging!  I may come back and update this game in the future to polish out some of the flaws and also add some of the features I didn\u0027t have time to in 48 hours. Have fun playing and feedback is very much appreciated!\n\n![download.png](///raw/9ca/e2/z/2c97f.png)",

        "body":  "Torch Bearer (first name Torch, last name Bearer), is the last man willing to light the Olympic cauldron in Japan and upkeep the 30000-years-old Olympic tradition. However, his relationship with his girlfriend Girl Friend (first name Girl, last name Friend) is going very, very poorly! Should she break up with him, she would splash him, his expensive custom shirt and, most important of all, the Olympic flame that represents the hopes and smiles of children around the globe! Can Torch keep the flame alive? Can Torch keep his love alive? Could I keep major gameplay features alive? All these questions are answered in Torchbearer of Love and Passion!\n\nSo yeah, it was supposed to be a mix of a runner with a dating sim, like some sort of endless dater. It\u0027s not really about dating, and it\u0027s not really endless, so it\u0027s more of a finite-relationship-simulator. But endless dater sounds cooler, so let\u0027s go with that! Also to foreshadow one of the earlier questions, the Ludum Dare deadline ate my sound effects. Ludum Dare deadline would also be a fine name for a dog when you think about it like that, wouldn\u0027t it?\n\nNote: Dreamcast port coming later.\n\nUpdate: Dreamcast port added + had to fix a crash when picking the wrong answer on the first question. Fail-and-crash is a bit too hardcore for vanilla (always a great DLC idea though).\n\nAlso this might just be the most cursed banner/title screen I have ever made, it\u0027s great and/or worrisome:\n![BANNER.png](///raw/a71/9/z/2cb2c.png)\n",

Click the image above to start!\n\nYou\u0027ll need a keyboard and some way to listen to the audio! Everything else should be explained by the game. \n\nMade with Unity, Nima, op-z, Audacity, and freetts.com.\n\n------------\n\nI came into this jam wanting to use [Nima](https://rive.app/), and had to toss many ideas before I could find something that worked to its strengths. I found it really satisfying to turn some drawings into a full experience over the course of the weekend, and I can see myself using this workflow to make more games like this in the future! Feel free to leave ANY feedback below, I can take it~\n\n#### MESSAGE FOR LD PURISTS\nI realized there was a scene missing that makes the entire thing make sense. As part of my post compo-time bugfixes, I added this in. I REALLY REALLY REALLY think you need this extra 6 seconds of content before the game to have it make sense, but if you want to play the game as submitted during the deadline, the link is below.\n\n## Patch Notes:\n - 10:49 PM 2020/4/19 Fixed title music not looping. Added pre-intro cutscene.\n",

Time to turn them on to the power of disco!\n\nDance around the dorks to turn them into disco freaks, and turn the punks into dorks (gotta start somewhere!) by throwing them some good wine. Once everyone in a club has been turned on, on to the next one!\n\nBut beware: the dorks and punks are also looking to make converts, with their boring classical records and broken bottles of cheap whiskey.\n\nâYou only have so much Disco Power to keep you going. When you\u0027re running low, grab a drink from the bar to recharge.\n\n## Controls\n\nDisco Lives supports keyboard and controllers.\n\n### Keyboard\n\n* WASD / arrow keys: Move\n* LShift: Dance\n* Space: Throw wine\n\n### Controller\n\n* Left stick: Move\n* A: Dance\n* B: Throw wine\n\n(Controller mapping is for XBox controller - others may vary)\n\n----\n\nWindows only for now - web build to come!

To select different objects, press 1-4, 1 being plant, 2 being bunny, 3 being fox, and 4 being bear. \n\n**About animal behavior**: animals have **6 different states**. Searching for a need, chasing/going that need, consuming that need, running from a predator, and in labor. The animals will do what they need to do the most. *EX*: if they are more thirsty than hungry, they will look for water. This does not always apply for the reproductive urge as they will not look for a mate unless the bar is filled to the brown line. This is just so that they do not have a ton of babies. Obviously they will not reproduce unless they are of opposite sex (determined by fur color: darker = male; lighter = female). The number of babies is random and can range from 1 to 5.\n\n*Bears will only eat bunnies if pretty hungry\n\n*Sorry about the cruddy music there is a toggle to turn it off\n\n**Visit help screen for more information**\n\n![Gameplay.png](///raw/c44/31/z/2c5c5.png)",

Once a tree is lit, it will burn down. Change wind direction so the fire can stay alive.\n\n## Controls\nYou control the wind, and that\u0027s it. Move around by keys (or wasd) and change direction with your mouse (wind will follow). You can also play with area/strength by using the scroll wheel.\n\nSoftware used: Unity3D, Blender",

It\u0027s been quite a long time since I last worked with SDL2, but it was incredibly fun to complete a project in such a short time :v: .\nWell, \"complete\" as in playable, there are still so many features I wanted to implement. But it runs, you can keep people alive and I\u0027ve got new inspiration for future works :smile: .\n\nThe game is played with mouse and keyboard. Mouse over the health bars at the bottom and press a skill (1-4, Q-R) to heal your party. Try to keep them alive as long as possible! I always liked playing healers in (MMO)RPGs, and with this minigame I tried to resemble the micromanaging you have to do as a healer to keep your party alive.",

        "body":  "Hi everyone,\n\nMeeple Machine Factory is a game about managing multiple machines with different components and making sure everything runs as smooth as silk.\n\nHow to play:\n1.Select meeple\n2.Right click machine and pick activity from the menu (Machine might have multiple components, so you might need to pick component first)\n3.Stand back and watch meeple do his job :)\n\nEach machine consists of multiple components (furnace, pressure barel, valve, ...). Each machine has a resource within as well (temperature, pressure, fuel). These resources will be displayed by the gadgets on the machine itself\n\nWatch out, some machines might be damaged due to high temperature/pressure. If machine is breaking due to this, the gadget that displays that resource will shake.\nIf any of the machines breaks, game is over. Keep them alive!\n\nGame is in very early stage, I managed to create only one level that I mostly used for testing. Eventually, bigger and bigger contraptions could be added and more and more meeples :D\n\nThanks for playing and have a nice day!\n\nNOTE: I noticed that particles are not working in WebGL build for some reason. So if you want to see nice particles, you should download windows version :D\n\nScreenshots:\n![1.png](///raw/fe9/z/2ca1c.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/fe9/z/2ca1d.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/fe9/z/2ca20.png)\n\n![6.png](///raw/fe9/z/2ca2a.png)\n\n![7.png](///raw/fe9/z/2ca2b.png)",

Use your power to provide food, resources, change the temperature or release deadly diseases. Keep tracking of everything you and the civilization needs and hope the civilization reaches it\u0027s modern age by the year 100.\n\n![Screenshot1.png](///raw/2ca/c2/z/2c9eb.png)\n\n**As a nature spirit you can...**\n\n- Plant trees and generate rocks that the civilization will use as resources to expand and develop technology. Beware that resources too far are hard to reach. They last longers but produce less.\n- Spawn animals the civlization will use for foood. This is the only resource you can\u0027t live with, specially early on, keep a good track of it.\n- Change the temperature. It affects many things. Highger temperatures makes people consume less food. Lower temperatures increase food consumption but reduce population multiplication, and also diseases effectivity.\n- Unsleash diseases. These will help you to control the population when overpopulation occurs. The more cells used by the civilization, the more the population can increase without falling into overpopulation.\n\n**The civilization will rise and expand**\n\n- Expansions occur when some criterias are met and allows the civilization to have more population.\n- Age advance occur when some criterias are met and completely changes how your civilization behaves in terms on consumption and productionm, while also changing how diseases affect them.\n\n**To win and lose**\n- To win you\u0027ll need to reach the modern stage of civilization by the year 100. \n- You\u0027ll lose if pollution consumes you or if you fail to keep the civilization alive.\n\n** Gameplay **\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rFI5OcgI20\n\n** Update 1 **\n\n- Added windows binaries for those with problems on the HTML version\n\n*I\u0027m aware of some calculations bugs. Yet didn\u0027t have the time to correct them properly, so it will make the game a little more challenging to win*\n",

I hope you have fun playing this preview!\n\nKnown bugs:\n* Rotating feels a bit weird\n  * I\u0027m not sure whether it would be better to align the rotation with the player or the Core. For now, it\u0027s aligned with the core. It may just take getting used to.\n  * I would have preferred numpad controls but I know not everyone has a numpad ;(",

Do the best you can, but the death of any plant is game over, man. Do you have a Green Thumb?\n\n## Helpful Info:\n\nThese plants need two things to survive: Water, and Room to grow.\nBut beware!\n\nWatering plants too little or too much will cause damage!\nYou can\u0027t see the roots, so it\u0027s possible the plant has out grown the container!\n\n## Tools:\n\n#### Grabber\nGrab planters and plants\n#### Inspector\nCheck the water level of the plant (might be inaccurate.. it\u0027s hard to judge just by looking!)\n#### Watering Can\nWorks on planters only! Each click adds a bit of water to the planter.\n#### Sheers\nWorks on plants inside planters only! Cuts a plant down if it gets too big.\n#### Remover\nWorks on plants inside planters only! Pops a plant out of a planter.\n\n## Obvious Bugs/Issues:\n\nPutting a plant into a planter is far more difficult than it should be. A different approach should be taken next time (this is in 2.5D and I didn\u0027t adequately manage sprite depth).\n\nGetting plants to grow doesn\u0027t seem to be working correctly. This might be patched - a note will be left if that\u0027s the case.\n\n## First Screenshot - Initial interior backdrop and a planter!\n![InitialConcept-0.PNG](///raw/529/6/z/2ab25.png)\n\n## Planting the Plants!\n![PlantBaby-AddPlantToPlanter.gif](///raw/529/6/z/2aed1.gif)\n\n## More Planters!\n![PlantBaby-AddingPlanters.gif](///raw/529/6/z/2ba0a.gif)",

Live.\n\nHow far can you survive in these procedurally generated ocean caves?\n\nLinks\n* **HTML5(WebGL)**: [dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD46](http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD46/#D=COMPO)\n* **Source Code**: [Jimbly/LD45-somethinga-from-nothinga](https://github.com/Jimbly/LD46-Sharkbait)\n\nThere is a high score tracker based primarily on depth / distance traveled from the spawn and XP level reached.  The kinds of enemies which spawn continues to change up until Depth Level 20 (changes every 2 levels).  You will have seen all enemies around a depth of 11.\n\nControls: Gamepad or WASD/Arrow Keys + E/Space/Enter\n\nYou can press Escape at any time to get to the menu, where you can disable the music.  The music didn\u0027t turn out very good :(.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n![ss1.png](///raw/dd3/z/2ccbe.png)\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/dd3/z/2ccbf.png)\n\n![ss3.png](///raw/dd3/z/2ccc1.png)\n\n--\n\n***Development Notes***\n\nTools Used\n* Custom Engine: [GLOV.js](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)\n* Mtn Dew\n* Sprites in [Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/)\n* Image processing in Photoshop\n* Sound Effects in [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/)\n* Music in Bosca Ceoil\n* The PICO-8 color palette\n* Fonts: [04b03](https://www.dafont.com/04b-03.font)\n\nMy plan was to do something fairly simple, and just polish the heck out of it, intending to spend a lot of time experimenting with some procedural music.  Unfortunately, I spent way too much time on the sprites, and ended up with not enough time to make even mediocre music (though it is arranged procedurally).  I\u0027m quite happy with how the visuals turned out, but feel every other area could have used some more love.\n\nI usually make very complex games, with a *lot* of text, and instructions, and tutorials.  This time I decided to aim for using the absolute bare minimum of text (just the title screen!), and I do like how that turned out.\n",

        "body":  "Stranded\n\nUNDOCUMENTED KEY -\u003e In the game you can press M to mute the music.\n\nIs a dice game that simulates being stranded on an island. You need to keep yourself alive by Hunting/Gathering Berries for food and Collecting water. You can collect wood and once you get 25 you you be able to build a signal fire. Once a signal fire is built you have a 40% chance of a ship appearing. You can also scavage the island looking for upgrades to your actions, but you only have a 40% chance of it working. It is possible to upgrade your scavage, max is 50%. If you go 3 days without food or water you will die and lose the game.\n\nMove the dice from the dice tray to a matching number in the colored panels. Sixes are wild and can be placed anywhere. Once you have finished placing the dice you can click the End Of Day button to process the actions. You get 3 rerolls per day. If you click the reroll button and the dice don\u0027t change its not a bug it just means you rolled the same number.\n\nTo win the game you need to get 25 wood, build a signal fire and then signal a ship.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\nThe Win and Lose screens are not working correctly. The wrong one might come up and the back to titlescreen button on both of those screens is not working as well. I deleted and recreated them both and it still does it. I\u0027m lost as to what could be wrong. So if you signal the ship and the lose screen comes up I\u0027m sorry :frowning2:\n\nLosing the game is not working either? Seems the counters for the number of days you go without food or water are not being updated correctly or perhaps my logic was flawed. Either way it doesn\u0027t seem possible it lose. If you happen to lose the game please let me know.\n\nThere is a misprint on the Build Signal Fire panel. Its says the wood required is 50. I apparently forgot to change that when I changed the number. The text under the panel that says it takes 25 is correct. ",

This fire will defend you from creatures lurking in the dark, repelling them with its light. But its special in another way as well. This fire is nourished not by lumber or tinder, but instead the finest dishes the world has to offer. But should it not receive the desired food, it will burn out, leaving you open and defenseless. In order to stay alive and keep your fire alive, scavenge your world for ingredients, and use those, plus your instructions, to cook dishes to perfection, making sure to put in the exact ingredients and cooking for the perfect time. Craft all three dishes to survive the night.\n\nThere are 6 possible recipes to make, each with a unique set of required ingredients and a specific amount of cook time. This game isn\u0027t quite finished, but should still provide the baseline of a playable experience.\n\n## CONTROLS\nWASD - MOVE\n\nLEFT CLICK - INTERACT\n\nQ - STOPWATCH\n\nE - INVENTORY\n\nR - RECIPES\n\n\n![4.PNG](///raw/ddf/c2/z/2ca9d.png)\n\n![5.PNG](///raw/ddf/c2/z/2caa1.png)",

This means that objects can slam into one another, rip away moons, or throw them off their orbits. \n## Controls/Tutorial\nThere are 3 moon types: Cannon, Repair, and Energy Production. Cannons and health use energy to operate, and energy production passively increases that. Cannons, shoot, and repair stations can heal your ship if its health is low by pressing \u0027C\u0027. \nF3 to restart\nX to fire your Laser Cannons\n### Game info\n* Music was made by me via Rymtik Studio.

Gather bonus nodes on the map and avoid the debuff nodes. Map is randomly generated and filled with buff/debuff nodes at the start of the game. Game timer starts when you connect the first tile to the root tile. Each tile will burn for a set amount of time before igniting the next.\n\nNotes:\n\nThere are some minor issues, but most of it should work just fine. There isn\u0027t a ton of strategy involved other than fitting the randomly generated pieces together in order to create a fuse that burns the longest. I didn\u0027t feel my idea came through all that well, but at least it\u0027s something.\n\n\nControls:\n\nWASD or Right Mouse Button Drag: Move the camera around the map  \nLeft Mouse Button: Select fuse tiles from your hand and place them on the map  \nT: Reshow the tutorial menu  \n\nMore information is found in the tutorial menu when the game is started.",

So, considering I managed to get something developed and up in under 24 hours, I\u0027m happy, bugs and all.\n\nI think the added time constraint this time really made me focus in on just trying to keep it as simple as possible though I still fell victim to scope creep along the way. I wanted to get full controller support in for this game and I was very close to having it working but the additional polish time needed to getting it working just wasn\u0027t worth it. Hopefully next LD Jam I\u0027ll make some time to get a solid controller experience together.\n\nAny who, all the music and sound effects were made in FL Studio. This was actually my first time developing on a Windows Machine in a long time and I\u0027m still very new to FL Studio. That also considered, I\u0027m pretty happy with my Western Soundtrack I put together.\n\nI used Aseprite for the art and this is a Unity project.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly simple and gear towards just trying to survive as long as possible and try to make sure the bandits don\u0027t steal your beautiful flower. This is no win state but I definitely look forward to hearing some high scores in the comments. I suck so I usually only managed to fight off maybe 15 or so bandits.",

Less ads attract users but too many ads and they do not stay on the website.\n- As your website gets famous, people will try to hack your site and you will have to protect it.\n- Old Hardware can also fail.\n- At the end of each month you have to pay your rent and bills and try not to go bankrupt.\n\n## I am a 15 year old student from India and this is my first Ludum Dare and RTS Game.

        "body":  "The idea of the game was to keep the bees alive by constructing a shelter with some random blocks. And also protect cactus from the rains so that they would flower...\nThe bee hive is there, the cactus, the rain, the flower, the bees, the moving of the bits and things to build. The score board is there, the music is there, some sounds were there but I think i disabled them by accident...\nEverything is there but a real game... not much game testing, you can build you dont have to protect the bee hive so much as not destroing it. the cactuses need some water, but not to much. I forgot to do the dry part during the sunny part of the game.\n\nIt was fun to do!! Enjoy this thing. \n\nhttps://github.com/dhmmasson/ld46",

        "body":  "**NOTE:** if the text appears to be going off the bottom of the screen. Zoom out in your browser.\n\n**_Area 64_** is a text adventure taking place in the fictional town of Withrope. You are tasked with delivering a package to Area 64, a top secret base hidden somewhere in the town. The only problems are: you don\u0027t have anything other than what you can find around town, You\u0027re told to keep the package \u0027alive\u0027 (whatever that means), and to top it all off you don\u0027t even know where Area 64 is! There are six different music tracks in the game so ake sure to have your sound on!\n\n# Controls\nThe game\u0027s controls are simple. At the end of each passage you are given a number of options in the form of blue links. Just click the links with your mouse. \n\n**_Note:_** In order to interact with certain inventory items you need to click the relevent button in the sidebar.\n![pic1.png](///raw/584/c2/z/2b7a2.png)\n\n# The Save System\nThe game comes packed with a save/load system. In order to save press save and in order to load press load (surprisingly enough). After getting certain types of game overs you are able to just return to the moments right before you died, however if you get a game over for one of the following reasons: Getting \u0027caught\u0027, fatigue being too high, or torch power running out you will need to restart the game.\n\nAlternatively you can press the little \u003c button at the top of the sidebar to go back to the previous turn.\n![pic2.png](///raw/584/c2/z/2b7cf.png)\n\n# Platforms\nThe game can run on most web browsers. It was only tested in Google Chrome, and iOS Safari. Firefox and Edge should also work.\n\nTHIS GAME DOES NOT WORK IN INTERNET EXPLORER.\n\n# Mistakes\nIf you notice any mistakes please mention them in the comments. Over 4000 words had to be written for the game, it\u0027s inevitable that I\u0027ve made a mistake somewhere and didn\u0027t pick up on it.\n\n# The Source Code\nIf you try to view the source all you\u0027ll come across is the games (few) graphics, music tracks and an incomprehensible HTML file titled \u0027index.html\u0027. In order to view the source code you\u0027ll first have to download Twine 2. After that just drag index.html into there. \n\n# Tools \u0026 Software Used\n**Programming:** Twine 2, Visual Studio Code\n\n**Graphics:** GIMP\n\n**Music:** Bosca Ceoil \u0026 Audacity",

Fly around the edge of the cell to find where the viruses are planning to mount their attack. After the preparation timer is up, blast the hostile DNA they release.\n\nDestroying the hostile DNA will drop protein points (PP). Once you have collected all the protein points head back to the nucleus and press E to interact. The nucleus allows you to purchase turrets with PP. Surrounding the nucleus are 3 mitochondria which offer powerful upgrades for PP.\n\nHopefully you are ready for the next round, because the virus is returning, and it won\u0027t be so easily defeated this time!\n\n## Controls\n\n- W - fly up\n- S - fly down\n- A - fly left\n- D - fly right\n- E - interact\n- Left click - Shoot",

(\u003e3h for the walls and you don\u0027t even see them!). After the first day there was no gameplay and I still had no idea what kind of a game I wanted to create. \n\nI had a little help with the sprites for the Alpaca (but I hope it still counts for Comp).\nThe end was SO STRESSFUL! I had 2 friend spamming all spelling errors in the dialogs xD that was realy hell.\n\nThere is also still one major bug: fire is rendered over the UI. I did some (not really)complicated rendering for the fire, so I couldn\u0027t easily fix it and until the end i prioritized other things.\n\n\n\n**About the Game:**\n\nPlay through an awesome story while trying to keep your flame alive!\n\nBut wait, the flame is not the only thing that you have to keep alive... ( \u003c- cliffhanger, play yourself to find out!)\n\n**Controls:**\n\nCamera: WASD\n\nDialogs: Enter\n\nMove Flames: Left Mouse\n\nShoot fireballs: Right Mouse\n\n![burning hell.png](///raw/239/41/z/2caa4.png)\n",

Sadly, the life force can be obtained only from other living creatures.\n\nTo give golem chance the alchemist sent message to the world about the mighty and evil golem and that for his capture he is going to pay the hero weight in gold. To avoid any trouble he sent golem to the world and told him to return as soon as he will regain his life force.\n\nYou are in charge of golem. Life force can be obtained by killing the opponents. Mechanism is build based on dice - meaning you set how many dice you want to use for attack and how many for defense. Oppoennt will do the same and the result is then compared. If you kill the oponent, you gain rest of his life force. Both parties are dealt damage to their healths based on the difference of opponent attack and its own deffense. If you loose your life, you also loose the game.\n\nControl:\nw,s,a,d \nmouse -\u003e click on opponent and you are going to see.\n\n",

I tried to make another one multiple times, but always gave up.\n\nI also gave up yesterday.\n\nBut the game idea wouldnât let me go, and so I had to start working on it again today. Don\u0027t expect wonders though, I lost a lot of time. In fact, better don\u0027t expect anything at all.\n\nAnd now, without any further ado...\n\n**The Ludum Dare Flame ð¥** is a massively multiplayer online cooperative clicker-type game about keeping a fire burning. How long can the LD community keep the fireð¥ alive? Will any trees be left in the end? What is your True Animal Name? Find the answer to these questions and more at [https://the-ludum-dare-flame.herokuapp.com](https://the-ludum-dare-flame.herokuapp.com)!\n\n![the-ludum-dare-flame-screenshot-small.png](///raw/830/1/z/2c005.png)\n\n- Supported simultaneous players: â**\n- Playtime: â**\n- Available fun per player: 1/â**\n\nI used base code ripped out of another one of my projects for the basic React/node.js/socket.io/MongoDB/Typescript project, because making JavaScript projects without a template leads only to madness. You can see that base code in the second commit. I also used the NameChange component from that base project because I felt too lazy to code it again. Everything else was made during the jam.\n\nPS: If you comment here, I\u0027ll play/rate/comment on yours too. Thanks for playing my game! :sparkles: \n\n*) over 5 years!\n\n**) slightly optimistic estimation",

Depending on the positivity of the messages, you help your friend more or less.\n![Gameplay](///raw/deb/a/z/2c67b.gif)\n## Context\nThe game uses sentiment analysis software to analyze the positivity of the messages you send to your flower. This sentiment analysis is from a [C# implementation](https://github.com/codingupastorm/vadersharp) of [the VADER sentiment analyzer](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and I\u0027m one of two people who have developed an in-review Danish sentiment analyzer, [SentidaV2](https://github.com/esbenkc/emma) along with tools for future development of the Danish sentiment analysis field. It\u0027s quite fun to use this in a game and it becomes a sort of citizen science project as well.\n\n## Media channels\n- [Itch.io](https://esbenkc.itch.io)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esbenkc)\n- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/esbenkc)\n- [Github](https://github.com/esbenkc)",

        "body":  "So this was my first foray into game jams and LD, and I have to say it was an absolute blast! It\u0027s been quite a while since I\u0027ve last developed any games, so it\u0027s fun to be getting back into it. \n\nMy game is called \"The Light Child\". The main goal of the game is to keep the small fire creature alive (by feeding it wood and protecting it from enemies), all the while also collecting four orbs so that you can rid the world of the darkness it finds itself in. The game is definitely on the harder side, but if you\u0027re up for a challenge, then this game is for you!\n\nControls:\n- Move with arrow keys\n- Pickup/drop items with space bar\n- \u0027z\u0027 to attack with the axe (direction is determined by which way you\u0027re moving), or to feed the fire child wood pieces\n- esc to pause\n\nThe game was made using Godot and all art was made in Aseprite (both of which I only starting learning on Friday :sweat_smile:). Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t get around to adding any music :(\n\nI look forwards to participating in future Ludum Dares, and hope you all have fun playing my game!\n\n![img6.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2cafc.png)\n\n![img1.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c836.png)\n\n![img4.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c83d.png)\n\n![img3.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2c84b.png)\n\n![img9.png](///raw/dc2/c2/z/2cb00.png)",

        "body":  "An online multiplayer (no limit to players) 3D variant of [Conway\u0027s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), where human players control special cells that can move around the game of life board between the generations and influence the surrounding cells. The goal is to keep your cell alive for as many generations as possible. Despite having the magical ability to move around the board between the generations your cell is bound to the same rules as the other cells in the game; it will die if it is not alongside **exactly** two or three neighbouring cells when the next generation is computer.\n\nTo add to the challenge your cell has a finite amount of energy that can only be replenished by occupying a space with an energy bolt when the next generation is calculated, so you can\u0027t just sit around on a stable part of the board.\n\nThere is an additional option to have a bird\u0027s eye view of the board if you\u0027d like to watch the magic unfold.\n\nThis is my first submission to Ludum Dare. I\u0027m not an artist so I just used very basic primitives and tried to do my best. I wanted to do more with the audio but this was my first time using Tone.js and it was a bit of a learning curve for me.\n\nThe backend is a node.js server running on an Ubuntu server, but was developed on a Windows 10 PC using Visual Studio 2019. I started the code on the morning of Saturday, April 18th, 2020 and put the final version up on my server around 5:30pm CST on the 19th. I was considering submitting this as Compo but I did use Bootstrap and FontAwesome for the UI overlays which might disqualify me from Compo.\n\n**NOTE** I am hosting the game on my own server [https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/](https://wip.digifi.ca:8869/) with a self-signed certificate so you\u0027ll likely get a security warning you\u0027ll have to go through to play.\n\n",

There are bandits, gangs and desperate loners who all need food, clothes and shelter to survive. Guns and ammo are hard to come by, but blunt and sharp weapons are fairly easy to find.*\n\n*The outlook is not good. People have gathered in commune shelters, trying to restart some kind of society, but most of them have since been raided or just started in-fighting which quickly escalated to mass murder.*\n\n*You are the leader of a small band of people, all scared and desperate. One of your good friends, may he rest in piece, shared a secret with you before he passed: somewhere in the \"Three Sisters\" mountains, there is a hidden commune which has both food and shelter. As a last resort, you have set out for this commune, and you now stand before the \"Three Sisters\".*\n\n---\n\nThe Three Sisters is an interactive novel where you have to keep your party alive and find shelter in the mountains.

Introducing Magic Atoth, the perfect breed of pet!\n\nGeneticists here at the Atoth company have been hard at work researching and experimenting to figure out the formula for the ideal pet experience, and this cute little thing is the result of years of dedication towards the cause! Now, there\u0027s no need to choose between any of the thousands of other pets out there, just select the one that\u0027s made to be perfect!\n\nBut wait, there\u0027s more! While a regular pet may be a money-sucking machine, requiring specialized food, care and living standards, Magic Atoth eliminates the need to worry about money by being able to live in any condition! It can eat any type of food, including the stuff you don\u0027t want, and only needs water in addition with that in order to survive, and live happily! In fact, we don\u0027t even charge you money to get one, we\u0027re giving them away free to anyone who wants them!\n\nThere\u0027s just one requirement:\n\n**Keep it alive.**",

You can close bulkhead doors to cut off areas of the ship to stem the loss of oxygen.\n\nThe crew will die if the average oxygen level drops below 35%. \n\nControls:\nWASD to move\nHold shift to boost\nSpace to interact with buttons and breaches\n\nCHANGE LOG: I re-uploaded a build a few minutes after deadline with a parameter change to speed the game up (as it was painfully slow before).\n\n(Heavily inspired by FTL :))\n![screenshot2.PNG](///raw/ebb/32/z/2ccda.png)",

You\u0027d do just about anything just to make the little critters happy.\nBut the entity you stumbled upon that Sunday evening in the deep woods was no ordinary pet.\nNo matter the cost, you will **keep it alive** by making sure it\u0027s well fed. Not just because of your love for animals, but also out of fear. What could happen if it\u0027s not... satisfied?\n\n![ss1.png](///raw/8df/7/z/2c799.png)\n\nDangerPet is a stealth game in which you try to get your *adorable* companion to devour as many people as possible\nwithout leaving any witnesses behind, as they\u0027re sure to notify the authorities.\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/8df/7/z/2c7a1.png)\n\n![ss5.png](///raw/8df/7/z/2c7ab.png)\n\nThe game has **3 endings**, 2 based on how well fed you keep your little friend, and 1 being a result of getting caught and the police getting notified.\n\n## Controls \u0026 general instructions\n\nWhile the window is resizable, **I\u0027d recommend playing in a 1:1 or similar aspect ratio**, as the games\u0027 text might go outside the bounds of the screen otherwise.\n\nThe game is written in Java, you\u0027ll need to have **Java 8 or higher** to run it, which you most likely already have installed.\n\nI am aware of the fact that the game runs abysmally slow. Probably shouldn\u0027t\u0027ve used pure Java for rendering.\n\n### How to play\nYou start in a small alley near your house at noon. You have 12 hours, or until midnight, to consume as many people unnoticed as possible. If any witnesses are left behind, they will alert others, and eventually the police.\n\nWait for people in less crowded areas with your companion hidden nearby, and wait for someone to wander in.\n\n#### Controls\n- **WASD** / **arrow keys** to move around.\n- **SHIFT** to sprint.\n- **I** \u0026 **O** to zoom **i**n and **o**ut.\n- Instruct your pet to hide or attack using your **mouse**.\n\n\nThat\u0027s all. Have fun!",

The only way to battle it is to make a fire and shine light upon it. However there is only little hope, since the Darkness is ever growing.\n\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/484/1/z/2c718.png)\n\nTake command of a small city featuring a huge bonfire. Construct coal mines and transport lines in the surroundings of the city. Keep the Darkness at bay until you have constructed enough propellers that will lift the city off ground and transport it to another place.\n\n# How to play #\n\n![Tutorial.png](///raw/484/1/z/2c71c.png)\n\nOn the left screen side you can select conveyors, buildings or demolition.\n\nIn the pipes menu you can choose to construct new conveyor belts or turn around existing ones. To construct a new conveyor belt you need to click and drag an existing conveyor node to another existing node or to free space to create a new one. Start your network with a city receiver (First buildind in building menu).\n\nThe following buildings can be built:\n* City receiver: Takes delivered coal into citys storage\n* Coal storage: Expands citys storage capacity\n* Propeller: Provides lift for city\n* Lantern: Emmits light if provided coal\n* Coal mine: Minies coal from adjacent coal deposits\n\n\n# Important notes #\n\nYou will need to unpack the zip-file before being able to play. The game requires a working Java JRE or JDK to be installed on your system.",

You have no idea how you get there, but the creature was there when you awoke and it relies entirely on you to survive. Gather food, keep your fire going, learn to fight, and craft multiple upgrades on your way down the mountain.\n\n![Combat.gif](///raw/233/2/z/2c410.gif)\n\nYou\u0027ll discover the answer to many mysteries along the way, as the story is told through a deep narrative that takes place as you play through the game. Each event triggers a new piece of the story as you try to patch together your memories about how you came to be at the top of a mountain. It\u0027s going to be A Cold Walk Home!\n\n## Controls\n\nArrow Keys or WSAD to move.\nMouse to attack, interact with the user interface.\n\n## Tips\n\n* Keeping your fire going increases your scavenging speed, as well as reducing the amount of hunger your creature experiences while at your base.\n* Watch your creature\u0027s hunger meter!\n",

        "body":  "Well. You are a simple man, with simple taste. You love your flower pots out in the sun. But it\u0027s hot. Like **REALLY hot**. So you have to constantly **water your plants** so they don\u0027t die. You gain points by **keeping your plants alive** and lose points by letting them die (not taking into account the emotional damage of seeing your plant buddies **WILT IN THE SUN**). Make sure to **refill** your watering can often so you **don\u0027t run out of water.**\n\n**Multiplayer Mode:** (This mode is REALLY the most fun / heart of the game. It can even get quite tactical, but PLEASE don\u0027t let it end like the average game of \"Mario Party\"...)\n\nPlants belong to the person who last watered it. This means they grant points to this player while alive, but also deduce points when dying. Try to score the most points by shoving and keeping the other player from watering and keeping your own plants alive.\n\n**Controls:**\n\n*Player 1:*\n* w, a, s, d / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\n* space / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\n* left shift / b-button: shove the other player\n\n*Player 2:*\n* up,down,left,right / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement\n* right shift / a-button : Spill water from your watering can\n* keypad 0 / b-button: shove the other player\n\nSelect stages by clicking on them. Return to menu by pressing Escape. Gamepad support is through SDL2. All major gamepads like 360 should work. My crappy age old ps1 ripoff controllers worked :-D\n\n[**PLAY THE GAME AT ITCH.IO**](https://vector-wolf.itch.io/extreme-garden-simulator)\n\n**Tools:**\n\nThis game was made with my very own handcrafted 2D Game Engine, called the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine). The Web Build is brand new and should work now somewhat reliably. I didn\u0027t know that even gamepads work with browser nowadays. That\u0027s what I call magic :sparkles:\n\nI made all the pixel art with [Krita](https://krita.org/en/). All sound effects are made with my mouth, recorded and cut with [Audacity](https://www.audacity.de). The music was done with the awesome [LMMS](https://lmms.io) using only its gameboy sound. The map was built wit the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) and my IDE of choice is [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org).\n",

        "body":  "# Game General\n## Description ð\nYou take care of Luda and her essential needs. If she wants something or she feels like she\u0027s had enough, she\u0027ll let you know. If you leave her alone for a while, she will not take care of herself. What a lazy bum! Everyone needs sleep and that includes Luda. She\u0027s asleep from 11pm to 7am.\n\n## Controls ð®\nclick the buttons to take care of Luda. Click the screen to switch camera angles. In the bottom left there\u0027s a reset button.\n\n## Features ð¡\n- A day night cycle based on real time\n- Dialog feedback\n- The instruments in the musical arrangement become more dissonant upon deprivation\n\n---\n\n# Development\n\n## Missed Features ð\nSome features that were planned but couldn\u0027t be made in time:\n- More facial expressions for different interactions.\n- Blinking of the eyes\n- The hair got scaled incorrectly after the models were imported by Unity.\n- I wanted to add a little camera wobble to make it look less static.\n- I wanted some sound effects for switching cams and pressing buttons.\nI started very late and had only 15min left to spare in the end. This is not a lot of work but it\u0027s still too much to achieve in 15 minutes. Originally I also planned for Luda to take potty breaks but I scrapped that entirely.\n\n## Tools Used ð \nAudio:\n- Audacity\n- Mulab\n\nDevelopment:\n- Unity\n- MonoDevelop\n\nOther:\n- Clip Studio Paint\n- Cheetah 3D\n- Screenflow (for the time lapse)\n\n## Disclaimer â¼ï¸\nThe compo states one has to work alone but unfortunately I can not provide voice overs for female characters. I asked a friend to do the voice acting.\n\n## Time Lapse ð°",

You got this name because of your belief in the value of life - any creature, no matter how evil, should be allowed to exist.\n\nIn this game you will attempt to clear a dungeon from zombies. However, as\nThe Pacifist, **you should kill as few of them as possible.**\n\nYou have two types of weapons - \nlethal and non-lethal. You can damage zombies with both types, however if you reduce them to zero health with a lethal weapon **they will die**. If you do so with a non-lethal - **they will be knocked out**. Be careful though - dealing any damage to an unconscious creature will kill them.\n\n\nFight off waves of zombies until you clear the whole dungeon. Kill as few of them as possible while staying alive yourself. Unlock new weapons as you proceed. Share your score in the comments :) \n\n  \n\nP.S. Unfortunately, I ran out of time so I couldn\u0027t make the music before the deadline.",

The slime creature in the center must be protected.\n\nTo buy turrets, you\u0027ll need coins - Get these by killing enemies. When you have enough, drag a turret from the selection HUD over to where you want to place it, then release the left click button.\n\nYou win once all enemies are defeated on the final wave, and lose if the slime creature\u0027s HP runs out. Score is gained by collecting coins and keeping the creature\u0027s health high.\n\n**Technical Information / Etc**\n\n**Programming:** Written in Java with the LibGDX framework\n\n**Music/Sfx:** Made up on a music keyboard then manually converted into beepbox.co for samples \u0026 layering\n\n**Artwork:** Slapped together in Gimp\n\n![screenshotblah346.png](///raw/3f2/z/2c775.png)",

The game gets more difficult as you play, in the form of faster decreasing health, as well as slightly more sparse energy further from the center. The world blossom\u0027s health deteriorates as its protector golem expends energy to create life in a newly forming world.\n\n**Controls**:\n\nE to deposit energy\n\nWASD to move\n\nScroll wheel or keyboard 1-3 to select an object\n\nClick to place a structure (on an indicator)\n\n\n\nâ**Objects**:\n\nEnergy:\n\nâPicked up by walking into, you can bring energy to the world blossom or connected trees to the world blossom. Press E to deposit energy. Energy can also be generated by plants.\n\nTrees: \n\nTrees make connections to the world blossom in a straight line, which act as additional deposit zones for energy. Additionally, the golem can move efficiently between connections to the world blossom, so the world blossom\u0027s health does not decrease on these tiles.\n\nPlants:\n\nPlants are an expensive structure that generate 1 energy over the course of almost 1 difficulty stage. To produce energy, they must have a free space in one of the four cardinal directions.\n\nRocks: \n\nRocks obstruct pathing, as well as connections between trees. They don\u0027t have any function at this time, but were planned to be used to trap enemies.\n",

Teachers hate them though, so they are usually banned at school, but the poor digital creatures can\u0027t survive the school day alone. *I smell a business opportunity...*\n\n## Virtual Pet Daycare\nThese kids are willing to pay big to have someone babysit their Omiga while they\u0027re at school (where are these children getting all this money?) \n\nIt\u0027s simple:\n\n- Press the green apple button when they are hungry, which you can tell from the orange fork-and-knife icon\n- Press the blue toilet button when they take a dump on the ground (how vulgar, these toys are for kids?)\n- Press the red pill button when they are sick, and you can tell they\u0027re sick by the orange frowny-face icon\n- ~~The red pill may or may not cause them to exit the matrix~~\n\nClients will be dropping off their Omigas constantly, but they\u0027re so easy to take care of I doubt it will be a problem. If one or two die, it probably won\u0027t matter, but if *THREE* die... well, that\u0027ll probably get your business shut down.

If you fish get sick, you\u0027ll need to give them medicine to make them better.  Accessories in the tank can help reduce stress and keep your fish healthy and happy.\n\n** Instructions **\n- Clicking the \"Add Food\" button feeds the fish.  You feed them 10 pellets at a time, and your total amount is 100 so be sparing with them.  Fish will only eat if they are at least 10% hungry.\n- Clicking the \"Add Medicine\" button medicates the tank.  Each fish will at minimum have 45% of their sickness healed, and each also has a chance to get most of their sickness healed.\n- Clicking the \"Clean Tank\" button cleans the tank, and removes any poop and food from the tank.  This stresses your fish, but if you feed them, it will help reduce that stress.  Cleaning the tank can only be done once every 60 seconds, and helps to prevent your fish from getting sick.\n- You can see stats for the tank, and each fish on the right hand side of the screen\n - The fish tank gets dirtier as food and poop decay.  Checking the dirtiness combined with the poop and food counts give you a good idea of when you should clean your tank.\n - Each fish has a hunger meter.  If this gets to 100%, the fish will starve to death.\n - Each fish has a sick meter.  If this gets to 100%, the fish will die of illness.\n - Each fish has a stress meter.  More stress causes you fish to get sick more often, and faster.  It\u0027s a good idea to try to keep this as low as possible.",

I felt like while playing it gave a sense of urgency and fear that you could come home and find your friend dead. If I had more time I would like to have put in some more metroidvania aspects, like puzzles and power ups that would unlock new areas. I think it could work well as a full game (with much better balancing).\n\nThank you for playing!",

Spend your resources wisely to repair and add cannons to the hull of the ship.   \n\nThis is a very quick piece after taking a few years off of game development. I had a lot of fun with this one for sure. I took inspiration from the first boss in Contra (NES) wondering what it would be like to play the defense wall rather than the players. I had stretch goals of adding more sound effects, multiple turrets, power cores to shield tiles, and a chatty AI that runs the station, but had to scale these items back to make the deadline. \n\n\n\nSimply click and build and make your way to the Eden Outpost where you and your crew will be safe!\n\n\n\nThanks for check out my game.\n\nMatt![Shadows_Cover.png](///raw/2ce/z/2c639.png)",

Next time I need to scale down my scope as much as possible. a little too hopeful(typical of LD)\n\nI hope you have some fun for what it is, I wish everyone the best of luck and have fun rating games.\n\nPS: I DON\u0027T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT I CANNOT BUILD TO HTML IN UNITY SO A WINDOWS EXE IS ALL I GOT - I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT!\n\nWASD to move\n\nLeft Mouse to shoot\n\nFind all the keys in the dungeon and escape with your life (and the Knights life too i guess...)\n\nIf you die, you lose. If the knight dies, you lose. Keep it alive!\n\nThanks for playing, I hope everyone had a great ludum dare 46!",

It\u0027s your job to keep them **WORKING.**  Use the **Robo-Launcher 2034** and see how long you can keep the turbines **ALIVE**!\n\n![Title.PNG](///raw/03a/d/z/2c233.png)\n\n---\n\n## Downloads and Links:\n* WebGL: https://fussenkuh.itch.io/turbine-troubles\n* Source: Available to download at the WebGL link\n\n---\n\n## How To Play:\n\nWindmills rotate **COUNTER CLOCKWISE** under normal conditions. They\u0027ll degrade over time. **CLICK ON A WINDMILL** and the Robo-Launcher 2034 will **AUTOMATICALLY TARGET** and **FIRE** a robot at the windmill. Stark looking for the next windmill that needs your help. \n\nWindmill will rotate **CLOCKWISE** while being repaired. The robots will over-charge windmills if left unattended. So, **SHOOT \u0027EM AGAIN** to knock the robots off.\n\nFinally, the Robot-Launcher 2034 needs repair, too. **CLICK-AND-HOLD** on it to bring its health back. \n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nOverall, I\u0027m happy with what I\u0027ve accomplished. I learned some new (to me) Unity techniques and brought a new game into the world... all in the span of 48 hours. I\u0027d call that a win! I\u0027m looking forward to checking out everyone\u0027s submissions :)\n\nI didn\u0027t have the full weekend to dedicate to The Jam. Considering the time constraints, I wanted to keep the game\u0027s scope small. Needless to say, the actual code leaves a bit to be desired. 24 hours means it\u0027s time to throw out my software engineering best practices and just start hacking.\n\nWhen played on the Web, I\u0027ve noticed that, on occasion, the background music doesn\u0027t always start playing and the audio, in general, tends to pop. If you experience music drop-out, try reloading the web page and/or pressing the [ESC] key to reload the game.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity 2019.2\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n* \u002798 Fender Toronado\n* The Google Machine\n\n---",

You take control of an A.I. that is aiding a human through multiple levels and is making sure they stay alive for their ultimate goals.\n\n## LINKS\n\n**Game and source code**: https://halisavakis.itch.io/machina\n\n## CONTROLS\n\n- Left click to select\n- Right click to rotate skill pattern\n- A/D or Left/Right to rotate camera around the environment\n\nThe controls are thoroughly explained in the first dialogue segment of the game.\n\n## SCREENSHOTS\n\n![screen_1920x1080_2020-04-20_03-08-21.png](///raw/2de/2/z/2c4e5.png)\n![screen_1920x1080_2020-04-20_03-09-30.png](///raw/2de/2/z/2c4ef.png)\n![screen_1920x1080_2020-04-20_03-10-12.png](///raw/2de/2/z/2c4f4.png)\n![screen_1920x1080_2020-04-20_03-10-44.png](///raw/2de/2/z/2c4f7.png)\n\n## CREDITS\n\n- Art/Coding/Music: [Harry Alisavakis](https://twitter.com/HarryAlisavakis)\n- Attributions for SFX audio files which have been heavily modified and used in the project:\n  - https://freesound.org/people/GeronimoGeronimo/sounds/338067/\n  - https://freesound.org/people/humanoide9000/sounds/422440/\n  - https://freesound.org/people/Speedenza/sounds/318560/\n\n## NOTES\n\n- There are known bugs especially with the level generation as it is pretty random and does not ensure paths will always be there.\n- The game is pretty unbalanced and therefore can be pretty hard, but I think it\u0027s worth it to try and make it to the end. There\u0027s only 3 levels with 3 waves each.\n- This is obviously not a complete thing on its own but it serves as a proof of concept for a type of game like this.",

Self destruction is the nature anyway.\n\nYou, God of Life, want to keep them ALIVE!\n\nBut for how long?\n\n## How to play?\n*Rules:*\n- You indirectly control the clans\u0027 behavior by placing food\n- Try to keep them from killing each other as long as you can\n- Or don\u0027t, just watch them fight!\n- (More clans is more interesting!)\n\n*Controls:*\n- Left click to spawn food\n- Use mouse wheel to zoom the camera in and out\n- Right click and drag to rotate the camera view\n- There is useful info in HUD, you can also check the box \"abundant food\" to auto-generate, well, abundant, food.\n\n## Screenshots\nThe static images of this game is far far less interesting than the actual game!\n\n![Screenshot (44).png](///raw/a8a/f2/z/2c721.png)\n^ 3 little clans\n\n![Screenshot (67).png](///raw/a8a/f2/z/2c6fe.png)\n^ Clans running for food\n\n## Known bugs\n- If you look straight down from above, camera would glitch.\n\n## P.S.\nThis is my first Ludum Dare and first solo game in more than 1 year. Hope you will enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it. I missed making games so much!\n\nI really can\u0027t compose by myself so this game has no music. Enjoy the visual though!\n\n## P.S. #2\nWhy is it called alive.io? A friend spotted that the colors I used in this game is very similar to those used in io games, and the mechanic of factions fight each other is similar too! So why not just name it io :p :stuck_out_tongue: \n\n## Credits\n- [bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) was used for generating sound effects for this game.",

You are given a plot of empty land and a little bit of money, and your job is to build up a forest.  Use the money you are given to place plants and animals, earning more money with each living thing in your forest.  But be careful: will the rabbit you just added reproduce out of control and wipe out your vegetation, or will the wolves hunt them to extinction?  Can you keep your forest growing, and more importantly, can you keep it alive?\n\nThis is my first ever game jam submission.  I have been teaching myself to code as a hobby for the past two years or so, and while I am certainly no artist or game designer, I\u0027m excited to have completed a project and get your feedback!\n\nCreated Using:\nUnity Engine 2019.3.0f6\nPhotoshop\nReaper w/ Native Instruments",

        "body":  "First, a .gif to start off things...\n![lia-short.gif](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c6ec.gif)\n\nIn the midst of shelter-in-home, I\u0027ve been watching a reality show called _Love is Blind_ like many other consumers.\nIn addition to that, I\u0027ve been watching \"Couples Therapist Reacts to Love is Blind\" on YouTube and it\u0027s been surprisingly insightful! [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRot2oCPvjI) \n\nHaving been shut in with my spouse for over a month now, I am increasingly thankful for vulnerable moments, and aware of walls that we put up when we are unhappy.\n\nThis game is a playful take on what I guess some couples therapists do in their job -- sort through anger, defenses, and find the true emotions and make sure there\u0027s two way communication.\n\nIn addition, I just wanted to experiment with procedurally generated maps, so that\u0027s what this ended up being. Just a one screen game about a couples therapy session. \n\nI didn\u0027t have too much time to polish up the letters, so you might find it not perfect -- but if you had watched _Love Is Blind_, I think you might recognize some of the sentiments!\n\nA longer gif:\n\n![lia.gif](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c708.gif)\n\nMore screenshots:\n\n![2020-04-19 17_22_22-LD46 - main - WebGL - Unity 2019.2.10f1 Personal [PREVIEW PACKAGES IN USE] _DX11.png](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c590.png)\n\n![2020-04-19 17_22_53-LD46 - main - WebGL - Unity 2019.2.10f1 Personal [PREVIEW PACKAGES IN USE] _DX11.png](///raw/e9d/c2/z/2c593.png)",

You must navigate star systems and collect essential resources to keep your crew alive. You have a very limited supply of fuel, oxygen, and food. Jump between systems and land on planets and rings to collect resources. Different planets yield different resources (fuel, oxygen, food) and some are more abundant than others. Eventually, safely reach a space station and bring your ship to safety. \n\nEach system is randomly generated, and planet surfaces are randomly generated. Use arrow keys to move ship and player around.\n\nWritten in Golang using Ebiten. I tried to get a WebGL version but the planetary generation does not work nice in a browser :(. I have versions for Windows and MacOS. Ultimately this was fun because Ebiten is such a simple game library, and I ended up spending a lot of time writing my own viewports, collisions and scene system on top of building the game. It could definitely use some more polish but I\u0027m still proud of what I did in 48 hours. \n\nDemo:\n![demo.gif](///raw/088/81/z/2c595.gif)",

I trust you won\u0027t let anything get in your way. And for god\u0027s sake, don\u0027t drop the heart.\n\nGuide the drone and heart through 7 action filled levels, but don\u0027t delay, because the heart cannot survive long outside a sterile refrigeration unit, so you\u0027ll need to be quick if you want it to still be beating when you arrive. Also, don\u0027t drop it. \n\nWASD or arrows to fly the drone. R to restart a level. \n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/2c539.png)\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/2c53b.png)\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/2c53f.png)\n\nTools used:\n\n- Code: Godot\n- Art: Aseprite, paint.net\n- Audio: Bosca Ceoil, sfxr, Audacity, MyChord, AutoChord\n- Font: Komika Axis\n\n\nMac and Linux builds, while available, are sadly untested.

But one day an alien robot came upon our lovely planet, and decided he likes it. Not only likes it, he loves it. He wanted to take everything on our plant with him. And he almost did it. The only defense left, is you! You are playing as a lonely Farmer named George. When everyone left to hide, he stayed and decided to face them himself. Will he last long enough?\nThat is fully in your hands!\n\n![georgeHow.png](///raw/d7b/8/z/2c1d8.png)\n\nThis is my first Game-Jam ever, and it sure was a lot of fun. The game have not turned out as I wanted. Please rate me and throw any kind of critique at me.

The maze isn\u0027t happy with simply trapping souls. You need to keep openings available to give the victims hope.\n\n\n\nControls: Mouse only\n\nPost-jam notes:\n- I think this came out pretty funny. The further you get, the more out of control everything becomes.\n- I think it could be a neat idea, but my execution here could have been a lot better.\n- I would have liked to have saved some time with the AI by just keeping it simple. It didn\u0027t end up working as well I\u0027d have liked.\n- Biggest missed feature I think would be something to make it clearer where you can and can\u0027t place walls. It\u0027s pretty difficult going in blind if you\u0027re having trouble working why you can\u0027t click in many places.\n- I missed out on audio, but given my busy life-schedule, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have time anyway. It kind of works without audio, but I would have liked more juice and polish.\n- The 3rd upgrade is broken, ignore it.\n\n\nAll criticism is welcomed.",

        "body":  "![ld.gif](///raw/173/6/z/2c4b8.gif)\n_**Hacking is Probably Not Like This**_ is a game that is (supposedly) about hacking.\n\nAnd how do we hack? **Puzzle games**!\n\n![ld5.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c2fd.png)\n\nIn the futuristic year of **20XX**, you take on the role of a **talented hacker**, **falsely accused** of a laundry list of crimes by the state, and set to be **imprisoned in 30 days**.\n\n![ld7.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c2f8.png)\n\nAn unknown benefactor reaches out to you and offers you a **deal** - **help them hack** the secrets out of the world\u0027s biggest and most infamous corporations, and they\u0027ll help **get you your freedom**.\n\n![ld4.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c2fa.png)\n\nBut you have to stay sharp - **keeping the machine you use running alive** takes lots of **energy** (electro-juice, natch), earned from successful hacks. Fail too many times and, well, it\u0027s lights out.\n\n![ld6.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c301.png)\n\n**Hacking is Probably Not Like This** contains **at least 11 puzzle games** (and **less than 13**) for you to enjoy, and lets you live out the dream of enacting **10 kinds of justice** to a **randomly generated list of over a hundred corporations**.\n\nIt is playable both on the **web** (in HTML5) and **Windows**, and you can find the **links at the bottom of this page**.\n\n![ld8.png](///raw/173/6/z/2c2f4.png)\n\n_**Hacking**_ was developed solely by myself in Godot over 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 46 Compo (Keep it Alive). \n\nIt is controlled with the arrow keys to move, and the Z key to select (with P to pause), and features autosave capability. It also features background imagery taken from my room, my desk full of anime stuff, and a nearby river which normally looks real nice, but currently is kind of brown.\n\nThere is no sound (sorry!), but feel free to put on your best lo-fi beats to hack/cyberpunk to. The font used for the game is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata).\n\n_**Hacking**_ is my second release under the label **300g curry lab**, a sub-label of my indie game circle **[300g curry rice](http://300g.megane-moe.com/)**. We make all sorts of indie games celebrating mixes of anime homage and nostalgic game remake, and I\u0027d be plenty pleased to have you either follow [my circle](https://twitter.com/300g_curry_rice) or [myself](http://canon.megane-moe.com) (invelica - previously sayumeki) on Twitter.\n\nThanks for your time! Happy hacking!",

        "body":  "The Center is a top-down action game where you can salvage robotic parts from enemies and install them in yourself after killing them. These parts include weapons, cameras, CPUs, movement systems, power supplies, etc. Certain weapons, for example, shotguns, rocket launchers, and chainsaws, break individual parts, which means that it is more difficult to salvage new equipment from the enemies you kill. Other weapons, such as tasers and lightning guns, can disable enemies without damaging their parts, guaranteeing that all of their parts will be fully intact and ready for you to salvage.\n\nIf you ever see an enemy that has an extremely powerful weapon or is capable of moving at extreme speeds, it is *always possible* to kill it and steal its weapon or movement system. *Every single weapon, movement system, or type of vision in the game is available for the player to use,* as long as you can kill the enemy.\n\nIf an enemy damages one of your parts while you\u0027re using it or you take a broken part from an enemy, you can still use that part, but it will have major penalties.\n\n*Weapons* - Broken weapons will fire at half the rate and will be less accurate.\n\n*Movement* - Broken movement systems cause you to move at half the speed that they would normally allow.\n\n*Camera* - A broken camera will periodically suddenly move, making aiming harder.\n\n*CPU* - CPUs kill you if you have one that has been broken for 10 seconds.\n\n*Power* - Power supplies kill you if you have one that has been broken for a full minute.\n\n![shoot.png](///raw/370/02/z/2ba2d.png)\n\n## Controls\n\nWASD to move\n\nLeft click to shoot in the direction of the mouse\n\nScroll wheel or F to switch between your primary and secondary weapons\n\nE to interact with dead enemies, as long as you are standing on top of them\n\n## Menu\n\n![menu.png](///raw/370/02/z/2ba4b.png)\n\nTo swap one of your components with the enemy\u0027s corresponding component, click it. To see the description for a part, hover over it, and its description will appear in the bottom left box. Broken parts will be colored bright red. Broken CPUs and power supplies will fade from white to red, and when they are red, it means that they are completely broken and will kill anything that they are placed in.",

If they max out their needs in any way they can lose health. Health cannot be regained. If your buddy eats too much, they will become overweight and lose health. \n\nPlay with them to exercise and lose that weight. If they become too dirty they will become sick and will need medication.\n\nA pill can be bought with enough gold.\nYou can acquire gold by digging their poop away. This will also lessen the chance of your buddy staying in it. Staying in poop will accelerate your hygiene levels.\n\nI recommend downloading it, if you can. It looks better and plays better.

        "body":  "About\n-----\nThe Supreme Beings demand offerings to avoid everything from being destroyed. They\u0027re fussy about them as well, and demand a specific offering from you, the Novice Adulator. Find the right one and deliver it to the place of adulation, so the Supreme Beings don\u0027t destroy everything. While you\u0027re wandering around, talk to some of the locals and find out what they think about their overlords. Avoid the gaze of The Watchers who do not like Adulators. They can look vertically and horizontally, but can\u0027t look through blocks.\n\nTo Play\n-------\nControl your character with the arrow keys.\nArrow keys do everything in this game - move and interact with objects and characters.\nIf in doubt just press the arrow keys!\n\nMy idea\n-------\nI wanted to create a retro style maze game in Bitsy with more game play than my previous Bitsy games. I managed to include a couple of puzzles in it. (1) Choosing the right offering based on a sequence puzzle at the top of the screen. (2) Choosing the right paths through The Watcher rooms. I had other puzzle ideas, but ran out of time. Originally I planned to create the mazes, text and tiles/sprites/items with a tool I\u0027d developed to generate them randomly, but that didn\u0027t work out. However, most of the graphics are tweaked versions of the original random tiles, and a lot of the character and item text was randomly generated as well.\n\nThanks to Adam Le Doux for creating Bitsy.\n\n![LDJam Bitsy gif.gif](///raw/fa2/3/z/2c491.gif)\n\n![bitsy ldjam april2020 screen3.png](///raw/fa2/3/z/2c496.png)\n",

Collect as many berries as you can while trying to avoid \"wasting\" crops.\n\n- Treat it as a toy more than a game. There\u0027s not a huge consequence to losing, really.\n\n- It is extremely easy to get a berry farm going that just produces live crops forever. Don\u0027t worry about it.\n\n- Crops are only \u0027wasted\u0027 if you pick them up when they are \u0027dead\u0027. Crops can be revived if there are enough live plants near them.\n\n- Berries will only form if Conway\u0027s plant can sustain in place for 3 days or longer.\n\n\n\nTips:\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns\n this wikipedia might come in handy ;)\n\n\nKnown bugs:\n\n- Dead plants will reset to first stage when coming back alive.\n\nAdditional resources used:\n\n- Super Mario 2 font https://www.dafont.com/super-mario-bros-2.font\n\n\n\nNotes: This was pretty rushed due to having roughly only 20 hours of the 48 hour jam to make a thing... it shows.",

You work for Ooolag the Demon King in his Dungeon as one of the custodial staff.\n\nAfter defeating the last wave of Human Heroes, Ooolag took everyone out for drinks to celebrate. Things got a bit out of hand, and now it\u0027s 2pm, you\u0027re hungover and you realise you forgot to clean up the dungeon before next shift!\n\nRush through the procedurally generated dungeon levels and tidy up before the next wave of humans arrive, if the humans arrive before you\u0027re finished cleaning and resetting the treasure you\u0027ll get fired and the Dungeon will shut down! \n\nHow to play:\n\n- Use W/A/S/D to move yourself around the dungeon. Move your mouse to move your camera, left click to pick something up. \n\n- Pick up bodies and junk (the cylinders) and dispose of them by feeding them to the Grue-in-a-Box.\n\n- Pick up gems from the top of your gem sack, and put them inside of a chest to fill the chest back up.\n\n- Mop up blood pools by moving the mop back and forth over the top. After you have cleaned everything, find the portal and move into it to avoid getting fired for being a lazy drunk\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/twu2ZMaaRbw\n\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_09-29-50.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2c529.png)\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_09-29-28.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2c52a.png)\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_09-29-09.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2c52c.png)\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_09-28-30.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2c52d.png)\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_12-04-26.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2ce0d.png)\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_12-06-40.png](///raw/2e0/d2/z/2ce11.png)\n\nTools used to make the game:\n\n    Game Engine:\n        - Godot https://godotengine.org/\n\n    Graphics:\n        - Blender https://www.blender.org/\n        - GIMP https://www.gimp.org/\n\n    Music:\n        - Abundant Music https://pernyblom.github.io/abundant-music/index.html\n\n    Sound Effects:\n        - sfxr http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html\n\nFollow me on twitter! https://twitter.com/stolen_biscuit",

        "body":  "**Battery Drain Boogaloo is designed to be played with a touch-capable device, preferably a mobile phone. You can play it with a mouse, but it will be a less enjoyable experience. Please download it for iOS or Android, or load the itch.io version in a mobile web browser.**\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n* The goal is to keep the device in front of you \"alive\" by ensuring that its battery does not fully drain. You can monitor the battery level at the top of the device.\n* The device\u0027s battery is TERRIBLE. It\u0027s constantly draining, at an increasing rate.\n* The battery is charged by a hand-crank mechanism. To keep it alive, use your finger (or mouse) to spin the disc at the bottom of the device. The faster you spin it, the faster it will charge. Spinning the dial will also increase your score.\n* At the start of the game, the battery is completely dead. Crank it up to 100% to begin - once it hits 100%, the game has begun and the battery will start draining.\n* Pay attention to the clockwise/counter-clockwise indicators above the disc - if an arrow is lit up red, don\u0027t spin in that direction or else you will cause the battery to drain even faster!\n* The device is actually a musical toy! You can press the various colored buttons while the battery is still alive to make music - but be careful to only press the button that matches the leftmost gem under the battery monitor. Pressing the correct button slightly charges the battery. Pressing the wrong one - you guessed it - will cause the battery to drain faster.\n* You cannot spin the dial and press a button at the same time.\n* Earn streak bonuses by pressing the correct buttons in sequence without spinning the dial. But be careful not to let the battery get too low while you are earning a streak!\n* At random intervals, the button layout will change, so pay attention!\n* At random intervals, the dial\u0027s direction arrows will alternate, so pay attention to that, too.\n* See how high a score you can get before the battery dies! KEEP IT ALIVE!",

        "body":  "## The Game\n\nA giant sperm whale was plummeting from the sky above an alien planet - a planet with strange constructions, built by unknown creatures - constructions of wood, metal and strange plastic-like substances that would prove to be lethal if the whale were to crash into them.\n\nLuckily, you are here to guide the whale in its fall. You and your joystick. *You have to keep the whale alive!*\n\n![2020-04-20 01.38.56.jpg](///raw/b88/z/2c3f5.jpg)\n\nThe [Atari 2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) (also known as Atari VCS, which is confusing as there\u0027s a recent product with that name), released in 1977 was one of the first home consoles. This is a game for that platform. A game about a whale that you need to guide so it avoids obstacles while it falls towards its home in the ocean.\n\n## Instructions\n\n**[Play it on the Javatari emulator online](https://javatari.org/?ROM=http://public.librador.com/whale-1.0.rom) or [Download the ROM to play on native emulator or real hardware](http://public.librador.com/whale-1.0.rom).**\n\nSelect level with left and right on the joystick. There are 3 levels. Press the fire button to start.\n\nMake the whale go left and right with the joystick. If the whale hits something, you get one more chance, but if it happens again, it\u0027s bye-bye, whale! :cry:\n\nYou succeed if you manage to guide the whale all the way to the blue sea.\n\n## Known issues\n\n  * The graphics on the level selection screen is misaligned on some platforms. It does not happen in the online emulators I have tested it on, but it can be seen in Stella 5.1.1 and on my Atari 2600.\n\n  * Sorry for sounding like a graphical artist, but on my Atari and TV set, the colors are very different from the emulators. Maybe because the TV doesn\u0027t handle the NTSC signal properly. Or maybe just because by poor Atari is very old.",

That build features a music loop made by me instead of the one by Faizyr used in the main build.** That\u0027s the only difference between that build and the others.\n\n```\nInstructions.-\n```\n\n**These are all included in game. You control the main character with either the arrow keys or A/D. You can pause the game pressing space. The game will end once you find the 20 birds.**\n\nThe game should activate fullscreen after the intro, **I recommend playing it on fullscreen**. You can also activate fullscreen using the icon on the right bottom corner (on the browser version) or pressing F on the desktop version.\n\n```\nMisc.-\n```\n\n**This game is harder than the ones I usually make**. Took me 4 minutes and 10 deaths to complete the last build before releasing it, then again, I had been practising for two days. Once you get to the end the game will show how many times you have died. ",

This time I wanted to create a Raycasting game with plain JS and HTML5. For sure that was a challenge ! Espcially when I realised that the tutorial that I was following only explained how to draw walls but not sprites :smile: .\n\nI\u0027m happy that I found some time to compose a theme and work on the audio even if I would\u0027ve like to create more assets (wall texture etc) and create more animations. \n\n\nI hope that you will have some fun playing my game :slight_smile: \n\n\n####  :warning: GamePlay notice :warning:\n\nUse arrow keys to move\n\nSpace bar to activate your power (you can go through walls) but mind your health bar !\n\n\n####  :tools: Tools that I used \n\n- Music : https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/ (great tool that I discovered during this LD)\n\n- Graphism : https://www.piskelapp.com/\n\n- Audio : My cell phone and https://twistedwave.com/online\n\n- RayCasting tutorial : https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/\n\n\n",

He fights various monsters and collects new weapons, potions and progresses on his journey to uncover the ULTIMATE power source.\n\nControls:\nmovement - WASD\nshooting - SPACE\npicking tools - 1-5 or clicking\ninteraction - F\ndropping batteries - mouse click\nopen inventory - I or E\n\nI mean this truly was an experience.

Players can walk, run, jump, double jump n times, slide, dash, wall slide, and wall jump!\n\nControls:\n- Keyboard: arrows/wasd = move, left shift = run, space = jump, left ctrl/double tap direction = dash\n- controller: Leftsick/dpad = move, bottom face button = run, right face button = jump, top face button = dash\n- slide = Down+jump\n\nLast minute addition of info written to the screen, lets you know the player\u0027s current state. It was hard to tell what was happening without animations.\n\nFinal thoughts: left/right dash buttons would be good. Game should be more floaty, things fall a bit fast. When dashing up player should keep some momentum at the end so they don\u0027t immediately start falling. Code wise I think its pretty messy. Let me know if you agree with me :)\n\n[s2.gif](///raw/d2a/f2/z/2c366.gif)\n\n![ldjam46.png](///raw/d2a/f2/z/2c7a7.png)",

It\u0027s been a long time since we had a scientist such as yourself come visit.\n\nIn Rewilding: The Story of Wolfhead Valley you are a rewilding specialist sent to help restore the valley\u0027s natural ecosystem after decades of human disruption.\n\nFor 3 (in-game, very short) years you are going to plant forests, seed meadows, and reintroduce rabbits, deer, and wolves (make sure they all have enough food before you do, or they won\u0027t last long!)\n\nEach spring you will have the ability to add more plants and animals to the valley, then sit back and see how it develops over the rest of the year.\n\nAt the end of the 3 years, your efforts will be judged based on how much wildlife you\u0027ve managed to keep alive. Good luck!",

        "body":  "![finish1.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c256.png)\n\nHi.\n\nThis is a game about kidnapping children and feeding them to an Evil Sewer Clown. Actually, Evil Sewer Clown is kind of a long name. But I just can\u0027t think of a name that fits better...oh well. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not a problem. And I\u0027m even more sure I won\u0027t get any threatening legal letters if I don\u0027t think of any better names.\n\n![finish4.gif](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c20d.gif)\n\n\"Wait a minute, there\u0027s no clown in that gif at all!\"\n\nYes, this is true. I don\u0027t know how to draw clowns, and therefore, I was unable to put one into the game. Also, this is the first game I\u0027ve ever made, so take it easy, sheeeesh. Anyways, that gif shows most of the gameplay. Drag the children into the sewers and run away from cops. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have spoiled it all in one gif.\n\nYou know, I hear if you get to Level 100 without getting hit by any cops, there\u0027s an awesome final boss fight where you rise up against the Evil Sewer Clown.\n\nOr maybe not. Who knows? Look in the source code if you care enough. And if you don\u0027t mind going blind from awful code practices.\n\nHere\u0027s some more screenshots. Everyone likes those.\n\n![finish2.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c27b.png)\n\n![finish3.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c280.png)\n\n\n\nAnd for the brave reader who actually made it this far down the page, here\u0027s an extra special making-of screenshot. Just for you.\n\n![progress1.png](///raw/aad/c2/z/2c28c.png)\n\nYeah, it\u0027s not that great. That\u0027s ok, neither is this game.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "body":  "_ Hello fellow Developers and Gamers!_ \n\n**First** let me start with this! I was aware about **Ludum Dare** for a long time, but I never participated in it. That changed this weekend :smile: ! I finally decided to give this event a go and to try to develop a game in Unity! I have messed around with Unity before, but I never managed to \"produce\" something. That changed today as I\u0027ve just \"finished\" my first \"game\" in it -\u003e **Keep E.T Alive**.\n\nSo as name of the game suggest I **followed** the idea of the **theme** ... perhaps too much :smile:. E.T has returned from his home planet back to Earth. He realized that he is missing some of the finest things from Earth - such as _Beer_ or _Meat_. But he is very exhausted from the trip so you need to keep him alive! Feed him, don\u0027t let him be thirsty and also clean after him. He may occasionally start to bleed as he is adjusting to earthly atmosphere again, so take care of that too!\n\n![e.t.png](///raw/d4b/03/z/2c447.png)\n\nFew **Notes** from my development process:\n- **Graphics** - First I wanted to go with pixel-art, but I quickly realized that I will not have time for it as I\u0027m not very - good at drawing it (it\u0027s something I definitely want to improve on in future). So I decided for super fast solution -\u003e MS Paint. All Sprites were drawn with it, hardest part was E.T itself as I had to combine different shapes, in different angles and sizes. I used GIMP for adding transparent layers.\n- **Code** - In my professional life I am front-end React developer so when I realized that I can just use VSCode I was super happy! I set up few things, configured some extensions and I started coding right away! I learned a lot as this was basically my first project in Unity (they made their docs really easy to read). One thing that helped me a lot was plugin iTween recommended by a friend.\n- **Audio** - This might have been my favorite part. I laughed whole time as I was creating and editing those sound effects. Good thing that I had that beer in fridge and also duck tape.\n\nThings that I would **improve or change**:\nBiggest problem was the time. There are a couple of things that I really wanted to add to the game but I just didn\u0027t have time.\n1. **Animations** for E.T - right now E.T looks super blunt and it worsens overall feeling from the game. I wanted to add expressions to his face when beer was close to his Infusion or face of guilt when he would poop himself.\n2. Another **Need** for E.T - there was a plan to add one more item iPhone with airpods. Player would have to give E.T airpods to both ears and then start song on iPhone (it would also change game sound loop) and than when E.T would have enough of listening, remove them and stop the song.\n3. Better **music** - game sound loops were the last things I worked on and it shows. I used this web app https://beepbox.co/ to create some songs but I am really not happy with outcomes. I felt like my head wanted to explode at some point.\n\nOverall I am super happy that I did this. I learned a lot, got nice experience and mainly it was **super fun**. I definitely will try next Ludum Dare! Heck, I might start working on some other game in meanwhile just because I might feel like it!",

        "body":  "Here\u0027s my second submission for Ludum dare\n\nI wanted to create a pretty chill game with childish graphics for this theme. You basically have to take care of a little flower. You\u0027ll have to give it the water it needs and defend it against dangerous ennemies !\n\nThe game is pretty straightforward and very simple, you\u0027ll have to develop the flower until it reaches lvl 5. The idea behind it was that it would become a beautiful orchid at the end.\n\n![Flower2.png](///raw/f7e/32/z/2c362.png)\n\nIf the flower has enough water you\u0027ll earn \"Flower points\" that you can spend on water, leveling up or to call the angry birds for rescue. It also gains health points if supplied with enough water. The more water it has, the more points you get. Water supply is maxed at 100, like health point and flower points are not capped\n\nSlugs will have a chance to spawn and will try to eat the flower. The chance of spawn raises with the level (very rare on level 1, not so much after). You\u0027ll need to call the angry birds to defend it. Watch out, each angry bird will only attack a limited amount of time.\n\n![call_the_police.png](///raw/f7e/32/z/2c374.png)\n\nI would have loved to add a proper soundtrack or effects for this game, especially with wind sound to add an ambiance to the game, but here is my compo for this Ludum dare 46 !\n\nDevelopped in Python, using the pygame library.",

In this game, you defend your campfire from the \"corruption\", glitchy ice monsters who HATE your fire.\n\n# HOW TO PLAY\n\nYou need to keep your campfire alive. Enemies will head straight for your fire from all angles, ignoring you completely. To defeat an enemy, smack it with your torch. Use your jetpack to move around the tundra quickly. If an enemy gets close to your campfire, a warning will appear on your screen to let you know.\n\nDestroying an enemy will increase your combo meter.  Keeping your combo streak going is the key to getting a high score. Occasionally, you\u0027ll need to stray far from your fire to keep your meter up. If you\u0027re in a situation where you don\u0027t think you can make it back to your fire in time to save it, you can transfer your campfire to a new location by burning a tree down, though this will clear your multiplier.\n\nHave fun, and thanks for playing!\n\n# CONTROLS\n\n- **WASD** - Movement\n- **Space** - Use jetpack\n- **Left mouse** - Swing torch\n- **Right mouse** - Burn tree, convert to campfire\n- **P** - Pause\n- **Esc** - Exit game\n- **1** - Switch between fullscreen/windowed. May be slightly glitchy!\n- **2** - Toggle screen shaders\n\n# TOOLS\n\n- **LOVE 2D** - Game engine\n- **Pico-8, bfxr, and Audacity** - Sound creation\n- **http://terrain.party** - Terrain height map\n- **https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font** - Font\n\n",

When you upgrade your phone, you make more money, and your battery life is drained slower. However, your battery will decrease no matter what level phone you are at. You can recharge your battery 0-10 times, (Different battery levels allow more recharges) but once it breaks, you have to buy a new one at Ahmazoon. To make the game harder, there will be hackers that drain your battery life at an inconsistent rate. You can also go to Ahmazoon in order to buy something that makes the hackers drain less battery each time. When you buy your phone, you will receive a question. If you answer the question right, you will get extra money to help you throughout the game. Answer it  wrongâ¦ and you will have to pay the price. Finally, have fun!",

But the catch is it was going to be a struggle to keep it from splatting on the ground while it\u0027s being transported.  Mostly just a story that went along with the mechanics of the game as they progressed.  Originally I thought about someone dropping a bomb in a factory, and a machine tried to keep it from exploding.  But I couldn\u0027t do the art for an indoor factory / lab setting, and I realized I could use the martian terrain from reference images.\n\nMy wife just asked me to dedicate this to her, so sure honey, this game can be dedicated to you!  It\u0027s my first ever game jam, and if I could do it all over again I\u0027d rush to get a fully working prototype up and running before starting any polish, audio creation, sprite creation, etc.  Had a great time, I\u0027ll definitely be submitting in October as well!  Good luck everyone, I can\u0027t wait to see all of your games! :)\n\nThanks,\nJake",

Your job is to keep their interest high by engaging in conversation with them.  That should be a snap, even for someone as socially awkward as you!\n\n## Controls\n- **WASD:** Move\n- **1 through 5:** Quickly select a conversation topic\n- **Q/E or Mouse Wheel:** Cycle through conversation topics\n- **Space or Left Mouse Button:** Talk\n- **Z or Right Mouse Button:** Research\n- **Escape:** Quit\n\n![lotp_ss_02.png](///raw/93a/z/2c37d.png)\n\n## Gameplay\n- Talk to guests in order to keep their interest high.  If interest drops too low (indicated by the guest changing color), they will leave the party.\n- When talking to a guest, they will reply with a similar topic (same shape or color).  You can only keep the conversation going by replying with a similar topic as well (same shape or color, but not both).  Any other topic will confuse or anger them.  (The first topic you speak to a guest about is always a good topic.)\n- You will automatically store the topic a guest talks to you about, replacing whatever topic you told them.  (If only one guest remains, the topic will not be stored.)\n- To get new topics or replace existing ones, Research on your phone, which provides a new random topic into your current slot.  This takes a couple of seconds, so don\u0027t be on your phone too excessively!\n- TIP: If the topic is not good, pay attention to the question mark\u0027s color to see what color it was, to get you back on track.  If they were angry, it means you matched both the color AND the shape.\n- If all the guests leave, the party is officially dead.  The timer will show you how long you kept the party going.  Fee; free to post your best times in the comments below!\n\n## Credits\n- All programming, graphics, music and sound were created by: Mark J. Hadley",

If you run out of fuel it\u0027s game over for you, buddy. You can create more fuel in addition to numerous buildings and upgrades by using the number keys while close to the fire. You get the resources needed for this by walking up to trees (and later on rocks) and swinging your axe into them. I\u0027ll leave it up to you to discover what all the upgrades do, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do fine.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![SkÃ¤rmbild (107).png](///raw/90b/2/z/2c1e5.png)\n\n![SkÃ¤rmbild (105).png](///raw/90b/2/z/2c1f0.png)\n\nControls: \n- W and S for forwards and backwards movement.\n- A and D to rotate your character and swing your axe.\n- Shift to sprint (when unlocked)\n- I to toggle ironworks (when unlocked, important to remember since they drink fuel like I\u0027ve been drinking tea)\n- R to restart\n- Escape to exit\n\nTools:\n- Unity\n- Krita (poorly used as you may see)\n- LMMS (also poorly used, playing in a wind orchestra for 10 years hasn\u0027t prepared me for this)\n- Audacity\n\nSince this is only my second original game ever I know it\u0027s not very good but I can\u0027t help but be proud of it anyway. Please make sure you give me plenty of harsh critique so I can convince myself I shouldn\u0027t be.",

Curious to see how far you guys can get :) **\n\n![title_gif1.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a2.gif)\n\nBodyguard is an entry in the ludum dare 46 compo. All assets and code written by me in 48 hours.\n\nYou are the bodyguard and you must ensure the VIP stays alive by killing any would-be assassins. You\u0027ll receive radio communications to help you pin down which of the civilians is really an assassin.\n\n![gameplay1_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a8.gif)\n\nOnce you\u0027ve found the assassin, take your shot before they have a chance to kill the VIP!\n\n![success_gif.gif](///raw/43b/31/z/2c2a9.gif)\n\nPlay progressively harder levels with more and more civilians but try not to shoot any innocent bystanders, they won\u0027t like that very much.\n\n**My high score is level 9, see if you can beat it!**\n\nSome tips for success (Read if you don\u0027t care to discover them yourself):\n\n* After 35 seconds the assassin can stab the VIP\n* If someone walks through the VIP past 35 seconds, they probably aren\u0027t the assassin\n* If you hear a sound and the screen shakes, the assassin tried to stab the VIP but failed. He\u0027s probably still close by!\n* After 120 seconds the assassin will aggressively seek out the VIP\n* Take a warning shot to stop the civilians for a second!\n\n**Here\u0027s a video of the game in action:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stg44OvBTqI\n\n\n\n\n",

Pick them up when prompted and take them back to the fire pit to increase it\u0027s fuel. Keep going until there is no more fuel.\n\n* W A S D/ Arrow Keys = Move character\n* E = Pickup item (when prompted) and close dialog boxs.\n\nIn the top left of the screen is your fuel indicator and the top right shows your current held item\n\n![gameplay.gif](///raw/30f/71/z/2c1de.gif)\n\n# A final word\n\nThank you for playing this \u0027game\u0027. I really appreciate it and i am super proud of what i\u0027ve achieved here regardless of where i place.\n\nThis was my first ever submission to the Ludum Dare 46 Compo! I previously submitted a game to the Jam in LD42 as part of a team; but this was the first time going solo! As per the Compo rule all assets were made by myself using the following tools:\n\n* Unity for the engine\n* Aseprite to create the pixel \u0027art\u0027\n* Bosca Ceoilâ to create the music\n* Audacity (and my microphone)to create the sound effects.\n* YouTube/Stack Overflow/Google for answers to my gamedev problems.\n\nFinally i tracked what i spent time on. Here\u0027s a quick breakdown: Sleeping/Breaks (19hrs), Dev (9hrs), Graphics (7.5hrs), Sound (4hrs), Polishing (6hrs). Total (26.5hrs working).\n",

You can speed this time up by applying fertilizers to the seeds.\n\nOnce they become beans they can be eating by insects and you also need to water them frequently. Deploy pesticide to make the insects stay away from the crops.\n\nYou loose the game if all your crops die, or get eaten.\n\nControls: You control the entire game with the buttons at the bottom. The tractor will follow a set path, so it will be easier for you to keep the early seeds in the path alive.\n\nHINTS: I\u0027m not sure the fertilizer is worth it right now, the growth time may be a bit to short.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES:\n\nTHe WebGL builds seems to have some issues with audio, I currently have about halft the sound effects, and another person reported they had none.\nThe game is also a bit to easy I think\n\nWindows build will be added shortly.\n",

The horror!\nBy pure accident Phil noticed the smell of coffee from a unicorn nearby, and desperate to get coffee, he caught it and tried to figure out where the smell came from and how to turn, whatever it was, into a nice cup of liquid caffeine.\nSo most important is to **keep** the **Unicorn** **alive**, to keep the flow of coffee coming. And what could be simpler than feeding it exactly what it needs? Nothing, just keep going.\n\n\n**Controls:**\n- Move - wasd or arrow keys\n- Pickup stuff - Space (hold)\n- Do action - e (Open close gate, toggle switch, draw water from well)\n\nThat\u0027s it, just try to figure it out. No tutorial here! Only learning by doing.\n\nKnown bugs:\nStanding on a coffeebean while feeding the Unicorn, will prevent you from picking it up! Workaround, just walk away from the bean and back on it.\n",

Thanks!\n\nMobile Users:\n- I\u0027ve tested the site on an Android phone and an Apple iPad through Chrome browser. It worked in both cases after clicking the \"OK\" button.\n\nDeveloper Notes\n- I\u0027ve had cellular automata on my mind recently and had been thinking about ways to incorporate it into a game. When the theme popped up, I had this idea of an out of control plant that you had to trim to keep it from growing into lava or being devoured by snails and things. This result ends up being a little bit more peaceful, but I may continue to build on it later.\n- One of the main challenges was passing nutrients around the cells. A cell can only manipulate itself in the current setup, so I had to make a system where the cells mark some of their energy for donation and their neighbors gain based on that value. I think a better system would have been to do a flow of nutrients outside the CA as a separate pass.\n- I wish I\u0027d had more time to play test and tune the sim.\n- Overall, it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve gotten to do a Ludum Dare and I\u0027m grateful for the opportunity.\n- The audio is 1) snipping branches with a pair of pruning shears. 2) grabbing tissues with gardening gloves on. 3) bfxr \"coin\" because I couldn\u0027t get a good bell sound.",

The theme was Keep it alive. You have to nourish the little sunshine with water and sunlight while defending against hordes of evil bugs! Stay alive for two minutes and win the ultimate price :)\n\nIt was a fantastic experience creating this game for the last 48 hours! I know that this game is not perfect and I know so many things to improve. Still, I would love to hear your opinion on it and recommendations to improve \"little sunshine\" enjoy playing!\n![Little Sunshine 2.PNG](///raw/016/1/z/2c087.png)",

Then share what you create.\n\nX33D is a slow game where you grow strange seeds into polygonal alien growths. Each seed is unique and grows in a unique way. Each generation of your seeds is slightly mutated from the last. Take your favourite seeds and breed them together to create new seeds beyond what previously existed. Discover new seed genes, and new seed types. Keep your genes alive, but encourage them to change and flourish.\n\nPlay online: [https://x33d.taybenlor.workers.dev](https://x33d.taybenlor.workers.dev)\n\n![xeed-cover.png](///raw/c7c/c2/z/2c0f0.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-20 at 8.42.41 am.png](///raw/c7c/c2/z/2c104.png)\n\nThanks to everyone who supported me and chatted online.

You\u0027re locked in the bridge, though, so you\u0027ll have to try and protect it through your archaic, virus-ridden systems monitor. How long can you keep him safe?\n\nThis is a purely mouse-based game, so no controls, other than clicking and dragging stuff - track-pad not recommended.\n\nInstructions are accessible in-game through the help button on the menu.\n\nTools used:\n- Unity\n- Pyxel Edit\n- GIMP\n- REAPER\n- Audacity\n- BFXR\n- Some custom tools available on my GitHub (developed for personal use only): https://github.com/AlexDavies8/Unity-Plugins\n\nMy experience this time around:\nI really struggled to come up with an idea past a generic platformer for the first couple hours, but once I settled on it, this is the most inventive I think I\u0027ve been so far. It was also much quicker through development than my previous submissions, and somehow I never felt pressured for time, even after polishing! It was also nice to work with more familiar programs, and to be able to use a DAW better than Bosca for music (REAPER can be got as a free trial version, but it seemingly never expires).",

Tulip needs to eat colored flowers to stay alive.  Can you pluck and feed them to Tulip fast enough?\n\n**Controls:**\n\nWASD or Controller - Movement\nSpace/Click/Fire - Pluck flower or feed Tulip\n\nâThere is no end to this game.  The goal is to see how long you can last before Tulip passes out from lack of nutrition.\n\n**Jam Notes**\n\nâMy goal with this Ludum Dare was to create a game my kids could have fun playing.  This game was intended to be easy to play, fun to look at and silly.  I hope it makes you smile.\n\nTools used: Unity, ZBrush, Unity, Substance Designer, Photoshop, Audacity, FL Studio\n\n![Screen_4.png](///raw/c06/z/2bf50.png)",

No fancy controls.\n\nIt\u0027s been developed over two days for Ludum Dare 46\u0027s compo. I\u0027ve made everything from scratch except the font (Bahnschrift) using Unity, C#, Blender, sfxr, Bosca Ceoil, Audacity and Adobe Photoshop. To create the original spacerock texture, I transformed two free texture packs available on https://3dtextures.me.â Also, everything is inspired, of course, by the original design of the Shadoks. That\u0027s why I opted-out the \"Mood\" category.\n\nThis is one of my first experiences. I started C#, Unity and Blender 8 months ago and had to learn by myself. Every piece of advice or critique will be very appreciated, but please remember I\u0027m new to it.",

        "body":  "I once again wanted to cross breed tetris with something, this time the idea of idle game came in very nice.\nSo, little white square is a guy that will fight other red squares. You can\u0027t control him, but you see his attack and hp. They hit each other taking turns, until one dies, after that new red square comes (might be stronger!).\n\nPlayer\u0027s objective is to collect tetris shapes.\nShapes have a chance to drop on enemies hit and when enemy dies 3 shapes are always dropped. You have to catch them all!\n\nShapes can be placed in one of 3 fields (or thrown away).\n\n**Blue left field**\n\nAny full horizontal lines will dissapear and player will be healed by 1 for each block\n\n**Red right field**\n\nPlayers attack gets charged, increasing damage on next attack (only one attack). If 25 blocks collected, damage permanently increased\n\n**Green bottom field**\n\nThis is sort of inventory field, shapes can be placed there temporarly and taken when needed, unlike other fields where shapes are put permanently\n\n\n\nHope you like it!\n\np.s. this is my first entry where I tried to make my own music, didn\u0027t have much time for that unfortunately. The track was created DAWless with Korg Volca Keys, Korg Volca Bass, Korg Volca Beats, sequenced by Beatstep pro and Keystep.",

There are just some strange circles into a playground bound via rules.\n\nSo I ask you to use your **IMAGINATION** a bit. \n\n...2020. Self-isolation and loneliness. We need to stay home to protect our friends and families, we aren\u0027t? But one `*****` always needs to move somewhere. It\u0027s a hamster. :hamster: When it stops, it dies. When it moves, it lives. Only other blue medical orderly hamsters can stop this crazy hamster using a special sleeping pill. You know these pills don\u0027t work properly. They are killing every hamster around. \n\nSo I offer to play hamster and KEEP IT ALIVE as longer as you can. Let\u0027s break the serious rules only in the games. Are you agreed?\n\nI hope you\u0027ll enjoy moving ~~an orange circle~~ the hamster and avoiding these nasty white ~~bullets~~ pills.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GU4052eCvGM\n",

The game might be impossible if you don\u0027t\n- The more people you convince, the harder your enemies will try to dissuade them and the faster conviction will drop\n- Green people are highly convinced, yellow are middling, orange are weakly convinced (but they still think you\u0027re right)\n- If you lose conviction, stand near someone who believes in your idea\n- Some people are more sceptical than others so are harder to convince\n- Everyone has their own charisma and confidence, just because someone is in your persuasion range doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re in theirs\n\n![HoldThatThought.png](///raw/2dd/2/z/2be90.png)\n\n![StartScreen.png](///raw/2dd/2/z/2be96.png)",

Then, use those resources to build more and get upgrades.\n\n![ImageBar1.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be75.png)\n\n## Instructions\n* Start by building some simple roots. Roots collect water and nutrients. Nutrients are essential for building more in the future.\n* Add some branches up top. Sunlight can be used for upgrades.\n* Get upgrades! The bugs can become a problem. You don\u0027t want them hanging around.\n* Get even bigger. There is nothing stopping you. Only rule, stay alive!\n\n### Resources\nThe three resources are water, nutrient, and sun. If any three of these reach 0 your tree will start to die. Be extra careful with nutrient, it is essential to expand and it is impossible to obtain it again if you run out.\n\n### Building\nTo start building roots or branches, press the build button located on the top of the screen. Then, use your mouse to select a starting location. This location must be on the tree. Next, pick an ending location. This location will be the point the branch will grow out to. If the line is red, it can not be built. The amount of nutrient required to build is shown next to your cursor.\n\n*Note: Branches can\u0027t go down and roots can\u0027t go up. Also, they can not cross.*\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-19 at 5.25.20 PM.png](///raw/b6b/22/z/2be7b.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n| Input | Function |\n|---|---|\n| `W` `A` `S` `D`  `Arrows` | Move Camera |\n| `Left Mouse` |  Select |",

Can you keep it alive?\n\n### Technical stuff\nYou don\u0027t need an account. Details about your tree are stored locally (javascript local storage). If you reload the pag, even if a long time has passed, the tree will show the correct state (as if it was \"running\" the entire time). Actually we just apply the missing time very quickly.\n\n### For Ludum Dare Testers\nThe normal game mode takes about two years for a full grown tree. To make things simpler there are two test game mode.\n\n#### LD46 Mode\nThis is the recommended game mode for LD46 testers. A full grown tree takes about 2h and should be watered about every 15 to 30 minutes.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/LD46/\n\n#### No-Zen Mode\nFor very unpatient players there is an even faster mode. A tree takes about a minute to fully grow.\n - https://wischi-chr.github.io/ZenTuree/FAST/\n",

In the middle of a rest cycle, Gale receives new instructions from the impossible. Could it be that humans have given new orders?\n\n======\n\nSunset Directive is a work of interactive fiction. I chose to do interactive fiction this time around because I have been working on Casementâ, an interactive engine for Twine. Sunset Directive uses Casement for inventory interactions, examination windows, and conversations. A good amount of changes happened during the jam, since this was the first time I put it to use! Several issues need to be worked out. \n\nSince Sunset Directive is choice-based interactive fiction, all you should need is your mouse or a mobile device. It should work fine on mobile (I put in extra queries for some of the windows at portrait). \n\nA note on mechanics. Casement has a system whereby you can use items that you\u0027re currently looking at (context-sensitive). Sometimes you might be asked for an inventory item, and you\u0027ll need to select it in your inventory. It doesn\u0027t come up too often, though, so I hope it isn\u0027t too confusing! \n\n======\n\nJSON for conversations was generated using the [JSON Online Editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/). It was immensely helpful for getting people talking.\n\nAudio samples were provided by [DSK Music](https://www.dskmusic.com/). Audio was compiled using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/).\n\nThe font used in Sunset Directive is [Quantico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quantico).",

        "body":  "I got into developing hyper-casual games lately. Even though I had planned using some different development systems for each jams, after announcement of theme I decided to develop a hyper-casual game. I wanted to extend it to a casual but that will be on full release I think.\n\nGame is simple, you are trying to protect animals gathered at the center of the screen. There are some alien ships who want to destroy animals. Your goal is preventing aliens as long as possible while not letting animals die from hunger. I am thinking adding some powerups to give some variety to gameplay and maybe a different part to see gathered animals (this is supported in this version to but I did not finished implementation). If you can give me ideas about gameplay that will be very helpfull.\n\nI codded whole game by myself there is only free LeanTween library in addition to my codes. I developed game in Unity. At the start my goal was participating in Jam but whole game finished yesterday so I decided to run for compo. I tried to try out some different tools and styles for graphics and I am aware that neither graphics not musics are good. I don\u0027t have a sense of art I think.\n\nAnyway time to make a game for Jam this time. Enjoy Precious Animals and keep them safe as long as possible for me please.\n\n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002636.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be88.jpg) \n![Ek AÃ§Ä±klama 2020-04-20 002716.jpg](///raw/377/92/z/2be8c.jpg)",

        "body":  "In **Your Pet Alien**, your objective is to care for your pet while also keeping your family from finding it. \n\nUse your **Closet** to **hide it**, and use your **Bed** to **heal it**. Every sound that you or your pet makes attracts your mom\u0027s attention, so you must be very strategic. \n\nFurthermore, doing chores makes your mom less likely to enter your room, and you get an extra bonus if she watches you do chores. You also need to be aware of where in the house she is and how close she is to your room.\n\n*Note: nothing is inherently scary about this game, but the atmosphere may creep some people out. This was influenced by games by Scott Cawthon as well as Baldi\u0027s Basic\u0027s :)*\n\n![LD46 Gif 1.gif](///raw/f22/c/z/2bf5d.gif)",

If I did I would have spent more time working on minigames that better tied in with the spaceship theme and in-game tutorials for them.

Overall though another fun game jam.\n\nHope you Enjoy and Thanks for playing.\n\n![Icon.PNG](///raw/ad8/d1/z/2bde1.png) \n\nHow To Play:\n\nClick on the consoles and play the minigame to fix them as the timers run out.\n\nMinigame 1 : \n\nThe ships self destruct sequence has activated, enter the code shown alphabetically to reset the timer.\n\nMinigame 2: \n\nA distant object is on a collision course, lock the horizontal and vertical aiming bars onto the target and destroy it before its too late.\n\nMinigame 3:\n\nThe Ships navigation system is failing, adjust the navigation screen until a complete image is shown, before you fly into a sun.\n\nTools Used:\n- Unity 2019.3.10f1\n- BFXR 1.5.1\n- GIMP 2.10.18",

It does not fully reproduce the IRC experience. \nUse it if the IRC method does not work.\n\nPlease note that any annotation you add in-game will be used as hint to other players.

So yeah, keep some of them alive too, just a small tips.\n\nThere\u0027s also a multi mode where you have to be selfish to get your own fire alive, but have to steal things and maybe try to bother a bit your opponent, last fire on fire win.\n\nAbout the author:\nI\u0027m fairly new to game dev (2 months) and this is obviously my first game jam, and this is litteraly an old dream becoming true. I learned a lot during these two last days, and i had a lot of fun coding this, so, i\u0027ll hope you will have fun too trying this out :)",

The objective of the game is to direct incoming blood cells to their respective \"tubes\". Each cell has a colour associated with it.\n\n# Objective\nSimply try to last as long as you can. Your score is counted by how many cells you direct successfully. Your \"heart rate\" adjusts accordingly depending on how well you\u0027re directing cells. If your heart rate reaches zero, you lose!\n\nThe player is able to \"collect\" a maximum of 3 cells at a time. Use the spacebar to release them as you want. After 3 cells are stored, any other cells that try to enter will be destroyed and your heart rate will reduce.\n\nThe game also features two \"power ups\" - a BPM boost, and a movement speed increaser.\n\n# Controls\n* Left/Right: Movement\n* Spacebar or Down arrow: Release cell.\n* P: Pause. (Alternatively click in bottom-left corner of screen.)\n\n*Only 64-bit Windows is supported. Sorry.*\n\n# To run the game\n* Download the .rar archive and extract somewhere using WinRAR, WinZip, or 7Zip, etc.\n* Run the executable file, \u0027Bloody Fantastic.exe\u0027\n\n# Made with\n* Unity3D\n* gVim\n* Paint.NET\n* Audacity\n* Bosca Ceoil\n\nEnjoy and please rate!",

AD/Left Arrow and Right Arrow to turn.

By pressing SPACE you are using 1 buff and healing yourself, but also your enemies get higher max hp, full health and random buff to statistics.\n\nTo take control over enemy you must have enaugh points. By taking control over hostile your old ship destroys itsfelf, and you get as many random buffs as you made in past. \nAlso all of enemies instantly explode and loose all buffs.But be careful. After taking over your health falls faster and enemies are spawning more frequently. \n\nSo enjoy playing. But remember - better way to defeat your enemy is to keep it alive and take control over it!\n\n![Scr3.png](///raw/ef5/c2/z/2bd24.png)\n\n\n![Scr4.png](///raw/ef5/c2/z/2bd8d.png)\n",

Some people want to dance and some want to talk - try and keep as many people happy for as long as you can.\n\nUp and down keys control the music volume.\n\n![party_alive_screeny.PNG](///raw/395/z/2bd32.png)\n\n### Technical things\n\nWritten totally in Pygame, with sound editing in Audacity. I always get bogged down in art in LD, so this time I though I\u0027d not bother - all art assets are generated on the fly programatically.\nThis was an exercise in writing for Pygame, and once I found the lerp function it was incredibly painless. Code is little bit sinful (big, globally-accessable dict to store object state and many many magic numbers) but I\u0027ve done my best to make it readable.\n\n### Credits\nCode by me (Thingus)\nBabble recorded during the compo and kindly provided by Aikidomorph, the Bad Decision Echo Chamber and the GRR.\nThanks to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/horstjens/ThePythonGameBook/master/pygame/002_display_fps_pretty.py for the jumping-off point\n\"Music\" by me (Thingus)\n\nThe author does not condone the depicted partying during any global pandemics.\n",

Use right mouse button to move your hand down.  \n\n**~ Tools used ~**  \nUnity, Visual Studio, Blender, GIMP, FL Studio (included stage grand), Audacity, jfxr\n\n**~ Special thanks to ~**  \n- my (remote) co-jammers and super-buddies Danny and Marius (will link their games once they\u0027re finished)  \n- my wonderful testers MÃ¶r and Kasi  \n\n**~ Timelapse ~**  \ncoming soon...  \n\nThis jam was just great and I\u0027m kinda in love with how the game turned out ^^. Looking forward to playing a ton of games in the upcoming weeks!  \n\nPS: Things I still wanted to put in the game but time ran out: Some scattered rocks or something like it, so the ground doesn\u0027t look so bland. Some more text. Some UI polish. Some way to prevent the core mechanic from becoming avoidable by just keeping RMB pressed constantly :)  \n\nPPS: A fun little story from during the jam. I sculpted all my models in Blender using a constant detail value of 30, which I believe is quite high, but it just allows me more flexibility, I feel (I\u0027m still a total noob, so any advice is appreciated). So I sculpted the tree in the game and Blender started lagging. I checked the faces-count and it was at a whopping. A 0.01 decimate modifier everything was smoother (and the tree also looked slighty better, less smooth), but I had already saved the .blend file before inside my Unity project and therefor inside my repo. And I had commited, but not pushed that file, which was 140mb large. When trying to push, I noticed that GitHub only supports file sizes up until 100mb (which is quite high already I guess). So in the end I also had to reset my repo. And I will never put .blend-files directly into my projects again (.fbx seems smaller anyway and also there was a bug with Unity and .blend-files that prevented multiple animations from being imported). Lesson learned :)",

Your citizens will go to work, social places and home every day. They can get infected by contact\n\n2. Each day, you will get one action point, you can use it to activate policies, take actions or close \ndown social places. Use your mousewheel to scroll\n\n3. Infection has an incubation period and will develop into \"asymptomatic\", \"mild\" or \"serious\"\n\n4. \"Serious\" infections needs to be hospitalized. Your goal is to make sure your hospital will not go\nover its capacity, i.e. flatten the curve\n\n5. You can pause/resume the simulation by pressing the button on the top bar or SPACE key\n\n6. Reovered people will get immunity. You will win when there\u0027s no new infection and the hospital \nhas not been overloaded\n\n### Modding the Game\n\nYou can easily mod this game by tweaking in-game parameters. You can create a sharable URL and other people can play your modded version! Share your mod in the comment.

        "body":  "![LandSquidBattle.png](///raw/5d8/f1/z/2bb71.png)\n\n**Spirit Quest** is an RPGish game. You will select a spirit and then utilize it in a Pokemonesque series of battles until you either fail to **keep it alive** or you triumph over the evil Demon Prince who threatens to destroy the land. Your journey will take you see many strange foes. Will you fight the legendary Ice Lobster or the ancient Lava Golem the choice is your with this games branching level select. Also this game features an option menu on the title screen which is always nice.\n\n\n**Instruction**: While the game does feature in game instructions on the main menu as well as in the description of the various pages the HTML5 version is on I will restate what is said there here for the sake of those who need it.\n\nThis game is controlled entirely by the mouse.\nAfter selecting your spirit you will be taken to a map to select one of the highlighted letters this will start your journey.\nIn battle you have four option\n - Attack which deals damage to the enemy and expends all your boost\n - Defend which reduced the damage you take and expends all your boost\n - Boost which multiples either your next attack or defense by how many boost you have stored.\n - Meditate which calms your mind and heals your spirit for a quarter of its current health;\n\n**Mac and Linux Support** as this game was made in unity I went ahead and built for both Mac and Linux feel free to download them but I lack a machine to test these builds on so I would expect that there are probably some bugs in these versions that I am completely unaware of sorry if this makes the game unplayable for you Mac and Linux users.",

I haven\u0027t even written a single line of code in that time, but it was a nice feeling to be back. Surprisingly, the whole development cycle went very smoothly. Scope was exact and achievable in the given timeframe, which was very unusual for me just a few years ago. It also has a narrative, which was impossible to fit in before (a feat of which I am very proud). I will attempt to fix any crashes on launch or game-breaking bugs even after release, but I will leave the original version available at all times. You can see any of the changes made here or on my github in the following weeks. I will also be making a full developer commentary and timelapse of the development, which I will embed here when available. I look forward to hearing what you think of my game.\n\n\n***19 April, 2020 - 23:19***\n\nThe first wave of feedback was mostly how easy it is to cheese the game by spamming bullets off-screen and killing everything. There is code in place to despawn bullets at a certain range, but it seems that it wasn\u0027t enough. I implore you to try going through the game without spamming the fire button. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience. This will eventually will be fixed in the post-compo version. Thanks for understanding.",

After you\u0027re plane has crashed in the middle of the Ocean, your only means of survival is a fishing rod. From a nearby rock, you must sit and fish to pass the time and to keep yourself alive. Surprisingly, fighting for your life can actually be pretty chill. \n\nThe game has 2 game modes to choose from:\n\n\n**Survival: **\nWith a timer counting down to your demise, you must catch fish to gain more time. Each fish adds a varying amount of time, small fish offer 5 seconds, medium sized fish offer 10 and large fish awarding a whopping 20 additional seconds of sweet sweet life. \n\n\n**Peaceful: **\nIt\u0027s just fishing, but without the shoe horned timer mechanics that I added to match the theme some what. Just relax and catch some fish. \n\n**How to play:**\nLeft click to cast your line, left click to reel it back in. \nWhen a fish is on the hook, smash left click repeatedly to reel it in. Larger fish require more clicks and will stay on the line for less time. Pull up with the mouse to reduce the number of clicks needed. \n\nYou can press \u0027R\u0027 to restart at any time and \u0027ESC\u0027 to exit to the main menu. ",

This is my 5th jam, but the first LD.\n\nIn the beginning I started a completely different game in Twine, but after a half a day I threw all of my plans into trash and started over. Hence, my time was way less as I expected.\nOriginally I planned that the dad has to cook, clean and to do other housekeeping activity, but I had no more time for such extras.\n",

        "body":  "![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 21-07-32.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2bbfb.png)\n*adventure awaits!*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 11-33-25.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b951.png)\n*picking castles, taking names*\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-19 19-17-26.png](///raw/bda/72/z/2b955.png)\n*the tunnels*\n\n### Intro\n\n**Late Medieval Network Engineer** is a game where you play a Network Engineer in the Late Middle Ages, responsible for keeping the connections between a group of castles alive while the King is away. \n\nTo do this, you travel through the tunnels between castles, dealing with technically correct monsters and fearsome HTTP status codes, or possibly the other way around. \n\n### Instructions\n\nControls: Pointer / mouse, but you\u0027ll probably need to be on a laptop (or tablet) to see the whole screen. There are instruction modals in the game, but just in case: \n\nGameplay is split into two phases. In the overworld, you must choose a castle to travel to from your current castle (which will have a blue marker around it). Once you\u0027ve chosen a castle, a red marker will appear underneath it. You can then travel by clicking the \"travel\" button in the left-hand pane. \n\nTravelling takes 1 day. You have to survive for 14 days. \n\nWhile travelling, you enter the other phase of the game. You are underground and must choose a route through a sequence of cards which will affect your status and the status of the tunnel you\u0027re in. You choose from the top row of cards, again using the mouse. Depending on your last choice of card, between 2 and 3 of this top row will be selectable. Cards not adjacent to your previous position will not be selectable. \n\nThe goal overall is to keep the network of tunnels healthy and also not die yourself. At the end of every turn, the network will suffer random damage which it is your job to repair.\n\n### Theme \n\nI went with this design because the theme reminded me of the [keep-alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) HTTP header, so I wanted to create something that was kind of HTTP but not really. In this game, you are keeping a network alive. \n\n### Details\n\nThis game was made using [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and my own tool for procedurally making sprites, [pixel-factory](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/). \n\nI like pixel-factory because it lets me keep writing JavaScript all the way through the jam without breaking flow and changing to another tool. You can see an example [here](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/#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) -- this is the worm card used in-game.\n\nI\u0027m pretty happy with the results (it\u0027s the first jam I\u0027ve used it for). Generally I think sprites went well with a couple of notable exceptions (health bars in the tunnels, probably a few others). \n\nI didn\u0027t get around to audio and wish I had now -- next jam I need to write less code and use more tools! \"amount of source code produced\" and \"how fun the game is\" are pretty much completely unrelated :smile: \n\nThanks for playing and reading, I appreciate it! \n",

Before the escape, Brightman managed to save the sprout of __Solar__, a flower capable of draining light.\n\nIn the dungeon where Brightman is hiding, itâs hard to find the light to feed Solar. Therefore, the hero uses the energy of stock crystals.\n\nWhen the Flower collects enough light in itself, it will be able to break through to the surface and disperse the darkness over the city of Brightman.\n\nBut the shadows continue to haunt Brightman. It is in their power to destroy the last magic flower and plunge the world into darkness forever ...\n\nThis Ludum Dare our team decided to make a Top Down Adventure Game. \n\n- Charge the energyy of your light with crystals.\n- Feed Solar (the flower) with light and keep it alive.\n- But beware of monsters in the dark.\n\nSome developments materials:\n\n![Artboard â 9.png](///raw/90b/81/z/2c0d3.png)\n\n### Feel free to play and leave a comment!",

I had been programming for few years already but still was stuck with Visual Basic (well at least not QBasic anymore). My friend was also just getting into programming and together we hacked up this very simple game in few hours and most likely spent way more hours playing it and competing for high scores. The game was very crude but somehow weirdly fun and addictive. It came to my mind and I wanted to try to see if I could capture that magic again. The game ended up not being very close the the original mechanically but the same essence is still there.\n\n**Flock for Feast** is an arcade style single screen score-attack game where you just try to stay alive as long as possible and rack up major points. You\u0027re in control of a flock of birds that are preyed upon by a vicious monster.\n\n---\n\n### ð®ð¹ï¸ [Download or play online on itch.io](https://anttihaavikko.itch.io/flock-for-feast) ð¹ï¸ð®\n\n---\n\n![fff-cover-v2.gif](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99b.gif)\n\n---\n\n### ð ï¸ Tools used\n- Unity 2019\n- Adobe Illustrator\n- Bfxr\n- Garage Band\n\n---\n\n### ðï¸ Gameplay video\n[Gameplay video](https://youtu.be/RB8JqLaN7dQ)\n\n### ð¥ Dev timelapse\n[Dev timelapse](https://youtu.be/DmwvkJ3IMrc)\n\n---\n\n### ð¥ï¸ Screenshots\n![a.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99d.jpg) \n\n![c.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b99e.jpg) \n\n![d.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a0.jpg)\n\n![e.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a5.jpg) \n\n![f.jpg](///raw/1e4/3/z/2b9a6.jpg)\n",

Word came to the throne of a bastard son, who shall rename unnamed from this day forth. The King\u0027s brother shall usurp the throne and has declared he will reign with iron hand. If the King\u0027s son, rightful heir to the throne, does not reach the castle alive, this shall be seen as a decree in which the prince relinquishes his right and bloodline...\n\nHis mother, the Lady, has instructed you to move the Prince to the throne, avoiding the Royal guards who have been instructed to stop you.\n\nMove at night... \nMove bravely, but most of all\n...\n\n\n\nKEEP THE PRINCE ALIVE...\n\n****GAMEPLAY****\n\nRun from one safehouse to the next, defeating all royal guards that are trying to take the baby prince. Be careful, once you drop the baby you will not have much time to pick him back up... All guards need to be defeated in order to enter the next safe house.\n\n\n****CONTROLS****\n\nThe control scheme for Long Live The King is extremely simple. You press [F] to wield your staff, use the arrow keys to run around and press the [DOWN] key to pick up the baby in case it was dropped.\n\nLong Live The King is an endless beat em up game developed during Ludum Dare 46, as a Compo submission. This entails that all assets (including audio) and codebase were developed within a timespan of 48 hours.",

If you don\u0027t, he dies.This makes for an extremely difficult game which requires a lot of smart thinking to get a high score. What is your next upgrade going to be? When will you use your insta-kill? The game can be frustrating from times to times but you have to just try again. \nSome screenshots:\n![4.PNG](///raw/1df/32/z/2b9ee.png) \n-\n![3.PNG](///raw/1df/32/z/2b9ef.png)\n-\n![2.PNG](///raw/1df/32/z/2b9f0.png)\n-\nHope you\u0027ll enjoy playing as much as i did making, this is my first ever compo entry!",

Thats the base rule to keep the game over away!\n\n## FAQ\n\n### It is lagging?\n\nYes i found out too late p5js has a lot of performance issues for the rendering in e.g. Firefox. Please **use chrome**.\n\n### Out of cash game over!?\n\nCheck out the cash history after your loss. Upgrades and low population are very exspensive. You have daily costs which you have to pay every 3 seconds. \n\n### What tools did you use\n\nSublime Text, Aseprite, p5js\n\n## Actions\n\n### Vitamin C\n\n![apple-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9aa.png)\n\nVitamin C will help your humans to stay longer alive. If you give them enough the chance to get infected will be lower.\n\n### Vaccinate\n\n![vaccine-0.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9b5.png)\n\nYour humans will be immune for 10 seconds after vaccination.\n\n### Water Storms\n\n![flooding-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9fb.png)\n\nNo Casino, no fun! Use this action carefully! It has hidden costs and it can rescue you in bad situations, make your total population strong for short periods or cause the worst infection you have ever seen.\n\n### Masks\n\n![human-mask-frame-04.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9bd.png)\n\nMasks will make your humans immun for one possible upcoming infection.\n\n### Money\n\n![inflation-5.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c6.png)\n\nMoney is important to keep live here. Print so much you can!!!\n\n### Trucks\n\n![truck-1.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9c9.png)\n\nThe game will get harder the longer you survive. With the trucks it is possible to reduce the mortality. But be careful, this action has hidden costs.\n\n### Breed\n\n![birth-3.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9ce.png)\n\nNo humans, no economy. Breed as much as possible. 100 population is max. Low population will increase the daily costs. So keep the population up.\n\n### Execute sick\n\n![execute-2.png](///raw/722/f/z/2b9d8.png)\n\nYou have trouble with infections? Just shoot them. A dead human can not infect others. Fast and effective!\n",

You need to help this orb to complete the mission.\n\nI always wanted to participate in a Ludum Dare jam. Finally I had time to do so. I hope everyone likes this game. Obviously because of the time frame, this game is really simple in terms of gameplay.\n\nThis is actually part of the compo event, so everything in this game was made by me including art, music and sound effects. Also the source code to the unity project is available below.\n\nBecause we are still in this covid-19 situation, I wish the best for everyone here. Be strong and stay safe.\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba90.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba91.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/7ba/f2/z/2ba94.png)",

What did that remind me of? - All that I have to do in my life - to manage the hard balance between everything in a world with so little time...\n\nWith this reminder, the only thing to do was to make a simulation game of living a life, probably my life - and keep it alive. This might sound easy at first, but it is not - and to be honest, I haven\u0027t done any programming for years (and didn\u0027t participate since LD17) so was a bit rusty to say the least.\n\nThe results; a simulator with questionable graphics, questionable sound, questionable game mechanics - but hey! - That is the results of my priorities in life!\n\nThanks for showing interest :)\n// Sune\n\n--\n\nThe GAME!\n\nThe concept is simple (and displayed on the beautiful non-virus intro page): balance the important measurable parameters in your life (the top 5 bars) by working with what you can spend your time on (the left 7 bars) - and hey!!!! you!!! - don\u0027t cheat looking up my scoring matrix and stuff in the source code!\n\nThe activities on the left helps you either increase or decrease the bars on the top.\n\nYou prioritize morning, midday, afternoon, evening and night (the five squares on the left). You can drag the squares to prioritize what you want to spend your time on with the consequences that follow.\n\nOnce in a while, like in any interesting life, events do happen! - When an event happens you have to deal with it - whether you want it or not - your life simulation cannot continue until then.\n\nThe game gets increasingly harder (basically since you have more plants to care for) so try to see how many days you can survive!\n\nGood luck.\n\n--\n\nThe source code is on GitHub and the game is based on Phaser.io and javascript.",

To pass the levels, small plans of when and where to go are needed.\n\nI didn\u0027t make the levels quiet hard. And the puzzles are not that serious (might be better if the time wasn\u0027t limited to 48 hrs). That means, if you play platformer really well you might finish the level just before the flame dies out without thinking about the strategy.\n\nIt would be better if there was more time. At least this game is able to show that the combination of lightning system and keeping alive can make action game more \"puzzle\" and puzzle game more \"action\".\n\nBtw I made sooooooo many versions of background music to fit the atmosphere. At last I decided to use simple chords loops and make all the sound effects with sounds of instrument rather than record more realistic ones. Well the result is quiet interesting XD\n\n\n![6.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c9.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c4.png)\n\n![7.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c8.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/2b8c2.png)\n",

Keep your torch lit via passing flames and reaching checkpoints as you descend deeper.  Avoid spikes, watch out for dowsing waterfalls, master difficult platforming and discover the ancient secret within!\n\nFairly tricky platforming, so congratulations if you manage to reach the end!  Your time will be displayed on completion too if y\u0027fancy speedrunning it!\n\n**Controls:**\n\n- Arrow keys: Movement\n- Z: Jump, Start game\n\n\n**Obstacles**\n- Spikes: Avoid these.\n- Water: Douses your flame, giving you limited time to reach the next light source before the shadows consume you!\n- Checkpoint: Restart here on death.\n- Springs: Bouncy!\n- Other fun stuff: You\u0027ll have to see! :D\n\n**Dev Notes**\nKept this one fairly straightforward this time. Liked the idea of keeping a flame alive keeping a tense pace through the platforming.  Game\u0027s probably waaay too difficult so if you manage to complete it Congrats! :D \n\n**PICO 8 stats!**\n- Created with: v0.2.0b\n- Source Code: Download the cart at PICO-8 BBS and load in PICO-8\n- Final tokens: 6507/8192\n- Char count: 28831\n",

        "body":  "You are the keeper of a lighthouse in the end of the universe. Keep it alive from hordes of evil guys!\n\n## Instructions\n\nTry to  keep the lighthouse intact  wave after wave of enemy attacks.\n\nâControls are optimized for a controller with analog sticks, but you can play with the keyboard, too.\n\n* Move: Left analog tick, WASD, arrows\n* Fire: A button, Cross button, Control\n\nDestroy blue asteroids for replenishing your own health, or red asteroids for fixing damage to the lighthouse.â\n\n## Tools and credits\n\n* **Engine:** [Godot](http://godotengine.org) 3.2.1.\n* **Graphics:** [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) 0.92.4. Used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) 2.10.18 for the icon.\n* **Sound:** [SFXR](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).\n* **Music:** As with [my previous space-themed game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/ld43-super-space-sacrifice), I created the music with [Otomata](http://earslap.com/page/otomata.html) and edited it with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).\n* **Font:** [Orbitron](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron), by [Matt McInerney](http://pixelspread.com). (Again, the same as my previous space-themed game.)\n\n## Author comments you probably don\u0027t care about\n\nVery happy with this game. The idea is not creative at all, but overall this is my most well-polished Ludum Dare submission ever! (I am particularly fond of the title screen: kind of minimalist, but quite moody in my opinion!)\n\nI had a playable game, with sound, music and particle effects at the end of the first day. I then spent the second day basically improving it: implementing better enemy behavior and new enemy types, adding asteroids, removing bugs. My latest commits (the last one was two minutes before the deadline!) added new sprites for the player and enemies, which were very ugly before and now are passably elegant (if simple).\n\nDidn\u0027t do much playtesting or balancing, but did a bit.\n\nOh, and if the game idea is not creative, I think the title is! :wink:\n\n![title-screen.png](///raw/61f/b/z/2cd91.png)\n\n![playing-03.png](///raw/61f/b/z/2cd9b.png)\n",

Time to get to work...\n\nHow to play: The game is over after 20 rounds or if you have 5 police tokens. You will need to buy cards from your hand and place them on the buildings. End turn to activate the cards effects and get a new hand.\n\nSome cards only activate when other cards are in the same building. For example: You need a keeper, tiger and a customer together in a building to earn money of the customer.\n\nPlay multiple times and find all synergies and combinations.",

        "body":  "__Covid Conundrum__ is a \"civil policy simulator\" that lets users experiment with the health and economic effects of various policies in a fictional county. Your county has 10,000 citizens and it\u0027s your job to keep them going in the best way you see fit.\n\nAll 10,000 citizens are modeled as individual entities. Some work and live in the same town. Others live in one town and work in another. Some don\u0027t work at all.\n\nAs in reality, you don\u0027t know who is carrying the virus--only who has been tested positive. If a town appears stable, there is still a risk in opening it up. On the other hand, prolonged restrictions may make your economy unrecoverable.\n\nYour county hospital has a capacity of 25 patients. Exceeding this amount will dramatically increase the mortality rate.\n\nThe simulation runs for 120 days--from 1 March 2020 to 29 June 2020. It begins in the paused state, and speed can be controlled via the buttons on the lower-left. When all 120 days have been simulated, the option to reset will appear.\n\n__Model Limitations__. The model is \"tuned\" to mimic real-world numbers in rural North Carolina, USA. There are some notable limitations, though. In particular, this model does not take into account traffic in and out of the county beyond a simple \"mutation rate\".\n\nOf course, the project is open source--so you can always modify the model parameters if you feel they\u0027re wrong. The files Simulation.hx, Person.hx, and City.hx contain the simulation parameters. The project was made in Stencyl. You\u0027ll need that, and the \"Text Utils\" extension to recompile the simulation.",

        "body":  "So this one is basically a find the button game with moving platforms. Originally I was gonna focus on art then decided nah, so gameplay is fun right? Hopefully... Anyways I didn\u0027t add the story properly but the aim of the game is for Henry and Alan to become super close friends, if they dont interact they lose their connection and well, you lose (Don\u0027t let their connection Die woAh). You play as Henry and you have to jump around the platforms to reach Alan. In the spirit of the Jam I\u0027ll be uploading this barebones thing but Ill probably update it as a personal project sometime in the future.As a disclaimer you only lose if youre below 0 points and you only lose points if you fail to get Alan within the time limit, no theres no pause screen so either be in for the ride or alt f4 your way out.\n\nIn case you\u0027re lost the controls are purely ASWD/Up-Down-Left-Right (moving left/right and jumping only)\n\nIts super basic and beginnery but I\u0027m really proud of it, finished it right before my mom could rant about my curfew (finished at 1:30am ph) lmao. Not gonna win any awards but ngl saying you finished an entire game in 1 day is great for resumes. Enjoy it yalls.\n\nP.S. about the music, don\u0027t record with your phone. You think it sounds ok, it isn\u0027t. And yes judge everything on here I know im updating it in the future but as a personal project, this is my full submission.\n\n",

        "body":  "**Keep Your Faith Alive** - is my entry for the 46th LudumDare contest. I created (again) a clever puzzle game with cubes. I am proud of what I did, and especially about code because this project does\u0027nt use any collider, raycast, rigidbody or light. All aesthetic and levels are created procedurally. Finally I have a good draw calls value - more or less 20.\n\n\nThe main gameplay is easy to understand but really hard to master. At start, you move a single cube (a monk) using arrow keys so as to reach a star on ground, keeping your unique eye upwards so as to pray some divinity. So you have some epiphany - an illumination and you nourish your faith. After first levels, things are more complicated...\n\n\nMy game has been posted as a **jam** project because as aesthetic I use a shader which I coded a few weeks ago and some useful scripts. Have fun playing. Rate my project and I will rate yours. I wish you the best. Stay At Home :)\n\n**I cannot work more time on this project as I want because I have to work now, delivering thousands surgical masks in Luxembourg door to door. Thanks Covid19 :)**\n\n![Faith01.png](///raw/991/z/2bf86.png)",

Change game\u0027s name half way through! Change the genre half way through! Add features!\n- Buy new stuff in the Asset Store for real fake money! \n- Manage your game! Balance your features and progress against the focus (or, well, boredom) of your team;\n- Hire new people! Fire new people! Their destiny is in your hands! Your destiny is in the hands of the random number generator!\n- Jokes! Not even sorry for most them!\n- Lack of tutorial! An exciting opportunity to venture into the unknown or a cut corner to get the submission out on time? We both know which one it is, but why don\u0027t we pretend it\u0027s fun!\nIt logs your progress! Relieve the fun memories of the past couple of minutes at the very end of your game.\n\nHow To Play:\n\nSo, about that lack of the tutorial.  \n\nThe main goal of the game is to get your game to the finish line. To do that, you must fill all 4 bars (Game Design, Programming, Art and Sound (last one is certainly ironic considering this game\u0027s soundscape)). Each developer you take on the team add points to the bars every couple of seconds (that\u0027s Delay stat). You can review each dev\u0027s stats on the Team screen.\n\nHow do you hire new people then? From the same Team screen. Just pick the devs you like from the list of available people and click them. This list refreshes every once in a while.\n\nNow, making indie games for free for prolonged periods of time leads to the loss of focus and Boredom. That\u0027s the grey bar on top of the bars. Every time it fills -- a developer you hired leaves the project. If you don\u0027t have any more people on the team and you yourself get bored -- that\u0027s Game Over.\n\nSo, how do you prevent it? Change the project over at the Project screen, of course. Add new features, change name, genre or theme -- go nuts. But, obviously, overhauling the project half way through comes at a great (well, -ish) cost. You lose some of the points you already accumulated.\n\nSome people on your team come with free money. Go over to the Store and spend it on assets to boost your bars and alleviate some boredom.\n\nAs your project comes to an end (successfully or not) you will be shown a log of story of your game\u0027s development. \n\nNow that I\u0027m writing this, I realize that you kinda have to Alt+F4 out of the game to start over, but it\u0027s a bit late to change things, huh.",

Unfortunately your new pet seems to have no regard to safety at all and would likely run into the dungeon no weapons, no protection and most importantly no plan!\n![LD 46 1.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89c.png)\nTo make sure your new friend doesn\u0027t die immediately there has been a shop stationed outside the dungeon with all the essentials like: Broad swords, potions and of course pizza!\n![LD 46 4.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89e.png)\nNow for only 8 gold!\nWhere was I oh yes... If you don\u0027t have any money don\u0027t fret the shop has a very lenient policy on selling Items. They\u0027ll buy anything including that bit of slime you carry in your bag for no reason. \n![LD 46 2.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b8a0.png)\nIf you need to get Items just go through the dungeon and kill some of the monsters that lurk there. Although I do need to warn you that improper extraction time (flee at the right time, I like sounding smart) may end up in a swift and unjust death for your friend.\n![LD 46 3.png](///raw/683/81/z/2b89f.png)\nUnfortunately your pet doesn\u0027t like running away and will sometimes ignore your cry\u0027s to flee and keep fighting in these situations we advise a dose of steak to keep your pet happy. Happiness does not only keep your pet from dying after IGNORING YOU FOR THE FIFTH TIME!!!! sorry got a bit carried away. An increase in happiness will cause your pet to be more effective during battles.\n\nThank you for reading this explanation on how your pet is going to di... I mean thank you for playing this game I hope you have fun. Tip: When you enter the dungeon your pet gets happier so fleeing isn\u0027t that bad, most of the time.",

        "body":  "It\u0027s a game about managing a band and \"keeping it alive\". But please read the description, what follows is an early little post-mortem of the game.\n\nSo. This is an unusual one.\n\nFor the first time in my Ludum Dare history (6 games + 1MiniLD + 1 warmup) have I failed to complete a game. The result is not very playable and there is no win nor lose conditions and I do not wish to continue to improve it. There are still bugs and the balancing is wildly inconsistent. \n\nI am obviously disappointed in the result but glad of the lesson learned (and I kinda like the Power Metal song name generator) : start small and expand on it. Do not waste time on big stuff and try to check if it is worth it and feasible  before starting to develop it. I spent less times on entries that are way better than this.\n\nI wasted a whole day on the map navigation and trying to add cities to it. In the end the map is useless and there are no cities on it because I approached the problem too naively and it would have required hours of work to place all the cities, for something that wasn\u0027t even needed by the gameplay.\n\nI still want to post the result because there is stuff to show. I barely finished the main gameplay loop with horrendous code during the last hours and now i don\u0027t want to ever place my eyes on it.\nBut I am not ashamed of it. I\u0027m sure it happens everytime to a lot of participants of the Ludum Dare. It\u0027s just part of the risk and I will continue to take part and try to make a more pleasant game next time. I hope all of you who reads this are proud of your creation and hope you get nice reviews. See you on the next jam and rate this entry as harshly as it should be ;)\n\nI have opted out of graphics because the only graphics are the ones in the UI lib and I didn\u0027t draw the world map myself obviously, just modified it to make it \"my own\".\n\n",

So make sure to obliterate those pesky enemies. You can control your character using W/A/S/D, aim using the mouse and fire pressing space (hold for more powah). \n\n*If you run this on an integrated card (Intel) there is a 50/50 chace of it rendering correctly. I don\u0027t have a fix for this sadly. If possible, share the \"log.txt\" with me so I can investigate after the jam.*\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZPdDungvk58\n\nFor those interested, I made the game using Waffle2D a simple rendering framework I made for the jam: https://github.com/piluve/Waffle2D\n",

I was inspired by my partner\u0027s love of houseplants and her constant struggle to keep them alive. She consults apps, friends, the internet, and professionals, but ultimately, it\u0027s comes down to her ability and love of her green grove.\n\nCheck out the [itch.io page](https://quixoticdicker.itch.io/grove) for a web playable version.\n\nThe engine is Unity. Blender for modeling. Gimp for doing some textures. Combination of Adobe Audition and Audacity for audio editing. Garage Band for music.\n\nI want to thank [savannah.smackdown](https://www.instagram.com/savannah.smackdown/) for some help with the audio.",

Plz forgive. ty)\n\nAlso I ran out of snacks, so if I could get an F in the chat from the bois, I\u0027ll be happy. \n\nControls: just push buttons lol you\u0027ll figure it out.

You can find it on SoundCloud if you are into that stuff, and it will probably be released on Spotify, because he does that kind of thing.\n\n@YuKey0 freaking ditched me this time, so if you were expecting to see her stuff, then I\u0027m sorry. @Rexxe did her best. (I think). \n\nSeriously, this is good game. We worked very hard on this. \n\nty.\n\n\nAlso, Android version will be put up on Google Play, but for obvious reasons, it won\u0027t be used as the submission, cos google be slow like that.\n\nPermissions required on Android: ![permissions.PNG](///raw/721/4/z/2b7b7.png)\n\n\n\nCTRL key.

You have a limited time to do so, and each item brought to the heart gives you more time.\n\nThe game challenges you with several puzzle-like rooms, where you have to manage the little time you have to collect the items in the right order.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Compo format, all the game and the assets were made by me, during the first 48 hours of the jam.\n\n## How do you play it?\n\nThe way you want. The game is compatible with WASD, Arrow keys and gamepads. Simply move the character like in any other game! You can pick up the items by walking on them and give them to the heart by colliding with it.\n\n## Thank you!\n\nYes, thank you for reading that page and potentially playing the game! :slight_smile: It is my first combo submission, so Iâm very happy if youâre interested in it! Comment with feedbacks and your own game so I can play it too! :wink:\n\nYou can follow me on:\n\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sticmac_JV\n* YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsPW9iLnrDY9XiUHV_P56Aw\n* Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sticmac/\n* Itch.io: https://sticmac.itch.io/",

If someone could tell me I\u0027d like to know!\n\n## Game Description\n\nIn a future where humanity has drained nearly all of it\u0027s natural resources, a group of oddly\narmed environmentalists have found the last tree on the plant. \n\nApparently they\u0027re somehow still able to receive nearly endless shipments of low-tech turrets.\nIn their infinite wisdom, they decide to make a last stand to preserve the last piece of green\nin a sea of gray and dirt...\n\n_**How long can you last?**_\n\n## Controls\n\nThe menus in the game are primarily controlled by arrow keys unless\nexplicitly stated.\n\nThe only mouse interaction is used to place and remove units.\n\n- Tab : In-game will show you the order and amount of enemies that will come.\n- Escape : opens menu or quits game.\n- M : can mute the \"music\"",

Concepts introduced include predicates, sets, and quantifiers. By introducing concepts one at a time in an interactive setting and letting related concepts build on itself, I hope that players will become more comfortable working with these concepts. I was probably a bit sloppy with some notation (for example, the Wikipedia page didnât have examples using sets, so including them might really be an extension of first-order logic or something like that). If you really know this stuff and notice a huge mistake, please correct me.\n",

I learned lots of things during the development and it has motivated me a lot!! I developed this game using my own game engine [Skygine](https://github.com/AsierFox/Skygine) done in SDL2 and I\u0027m so proud of it :)\nI hope that with the experience achived here I can improve my own skills of developmnet and design!! Thank you so much for playing my game and see you in the next LD!! :wink: ",

Training it will help with working speed but working and training does take the shine off life a bit.\n\nPats are free though.

Training will increase your pets work speed (hidden) however it really doesn\u0027t like training!\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n![gameplay2.gif](///raw/c46/81/z/2c928.gif)\n\n![V1-0 gameplay.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b664.png)\n\n![V1-0 tutorial.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b666.png)\n\n![StartScreen.png](///raw/c46/81/z/2b667.png)\n\n*This game was made for Ludum Dare 46 Compo, a 48 hour solo Game Jam.*\n\nThe game was developed from scratch in an empty Unity project.

You have to redirect the sunlight between the crops or the solar panels. Without electricity we will have no way of keeping the crops watered. \n\nThe battery in the solar room will show you how much energy you have.The water meter in the pump room shows you the water pressure. The terminal will keep track of the crops, make sure to check that.\n\nYour crops should grow in about 5 days.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nHow the game is played:\n![map.png](///raw/f79/a/z/2b5f3.png)\nThe map above shows the different rooms.\n - Water Meter shows water pressure\n - Battery shows energy levels\n - Mirror can be dragged by interacting with it\n - Terminal will show stats about the crops by interacting\n\n![terminal.png](///raw/f79/a/z/2b5f9.png)\nThis is the terminal view\n - Sun icon is sunlight levels\n - Water drop is the hydration levels\n - Cross is the health of the crops\n\n![clock.png](///raw/f79/a/z/2b5f7.png)\nThe clock shows the current day and time\n\n![notifications.png](///raw/f79/a/z/2b5f8.png)\nThe notifications will show in the top left corner when the associated value goes below 40%\n\nAnything that glows green means you can interact with it.\n\nControls:\n WASD - Move\n Mouse Left Click - Interact",

You have to personally choose which crops to grow and sell to merchants in exchange for gold coins to save the farm. Some crops have short planting time and low yield, and some grow for a long time with high yields. Water and fertilizer in the soil decrease over time, and you need gold coins in exchange for water and fertilizer. How to bring the farm back to life, it\u0027s all about your choices. By the way, the crop will wither if you don\u0027t log on to the game for a long time.\n### About Us\nThis is the first time my friend tww and I have participated in LD together. The size of the game is small. There was no way out. There were only two of us, and neither of us could do art. By the way it\u0027s a very exciting 72-hour way to make a game, It makes us less likely to procrastinate. We will continue to do more fun games in the future, we hope you support a lot. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n### + ä¸­æ +\n### å\u0085³äºæ¸¸æ\nååºå·²ç»æ¿ä¸´ç ´äº§ï¼ä½ éè¦äº²èªå»éæ©ç§æ¤åªç§ä½ç©åç»åäººæ¢åéå¸æ¯æååºï¼æçä½ç©ç§æ¤æ¶é´ç­ï¼æ¶çä½ï¼æçæ¶é´é¿ï¼æ¶çé«ï¼åå£¤ä¸­çæ°´ååè¥æä¼éçæ¶é´åå°èåå°ï¼ä½ éè¦ç¨éå¸å»æ¢åæ°´ååè¥æï¼æä¹æ ·è®©ååºèµ·æ­»åçï¼ä¸åé½é ä½ çéæ©ï¼é¡ºä¾¿è¯´ä¸å¥ï¼é¿æ¶é´ä¸ç»æ¸¸æçè¯ä½ç©ä¼æ¯èç\n### å\u0085³äºæä»¬\nè¿æ¯æåææåtwwé¦æ¬¡åä½åå LDï¼è¿ä¸ªæ¸¸æä½éä¸å¤§ï¼æ²¡æåæ³æä»¬åªæä¸¤ä¸ªäººï¼èä¸é½ä¸ä¼ç¾å·¥ï¼ï¼è¿ç§72å°æ¶åä¸æ¬¾æ¸¸æçæ¹å¼æºåºæ¿çï¼å¯ä»¥æ²»ä¸ä¸æä»¬çæå»¶çï¼æä»¬ä»¥åä¹ä¼ç»§ç»­åæ´å¤å¥½ç©çæ¸¸æï¼å¸æå¤§å®¶å¤å¤æ¯æ",

I used Construct for the game engine, Photoshop for all graphics (except Ludum Dare logo), and audacity for all the sounds ( except main music ). \n\nPet Life, a home for your animals. Buy different types of animals, and feed them and play with them to keep them alive and happy!  The more updated it gets, the more options there are for and endless gaming pet experience. I was hoping to add more features, such as multiple animals, toys and stuff in the shop. But alas, I made what I made with the time I had possible. I hope you all enjoy! \n\nThe full source code is available if you wish to learn from this or build onto it!\n\nThe absolutely ONLY two things I did not make myself during this 48 hours, was the LUDUM DARE logo included on the Cover Image and Main Menu of the game! As well as the main game music, this was made by SirJoan620 during Ludum Dare for Ludum Dare entries. All visuals, code, and all the other audio was done by me during Ludum Dare!",

Hope you enjoy!\n\nAll code, sprites and sounds were created by me.\nFont used is Arch Rival and can be found here:  https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/SF-Arch-Rival\n\n## Description\n\nBaby is an egg. For some reason, your species gives birth in the middle of space. It\u0027s pretty dangerous out there. You need to protect baby until it grows up and can fend for itself. Keep it alive!\n![screensho1.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b523.png)\n\n## Controls\n\n[A] and [D] - rotate your ship around the egg\n\n[J] - fire bullets\n\n[L] - grab the nearest item, when it is fully charged\n\n\n## Gameplay\n\nHealth - This is the health of you and Baby combined. Don\u0027t let it drop to zero or you will lose.\n\nGrab - When this bar is full you can pull the closest item towards you to give it to Baby.\n\nGrowth - You win when this timer is full.\n\n\nBaby will randomly get bored, hungry or thirsty. Getting it the correct item will boost the growth bar, but providing the wrong item will decrease it!\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b525.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/de5/03/z/2b527.png)\n\n## Tips\n\nYou can destroy items you don\u0027t want by shooting them. Remember, you can only grab the item closest to you.",

In one moment I was really close to stop my LD jam. But then I found this fantastic platformer mechanic which make my platformer totally epic. I know this mechanic has more potential then I put into my levels but I dont want to create hard unplayable game, like I did last time :). Pls let me know what you think about this game mechanic, did you saw that in any game?\n\nIn this game you are jinxed to have your heart outside of your body and you must take care about it. Keep it alive to the finish flag, thats it.\n\nControls:\n-horizontal movement \n\n-up arrow to jump! \n\n-space to speed up the cycle\n\n\nfollow my twitter https://twitter.com/OneGuystruggle\n\n\nUsed agme engine UNITY, audio recorded in Audacity, \"art\" in paint.net\n\nif you find a heartbreaking bug or you are not able to run the game pls let me know in the comment section\n\n\n",

In setting up for Ludum Dare, I decided I wanted to make a game that instilled a sense of calm and thoughtfulness, rather than one of manic action.\n\n For this reason, I took inspiration from the Mathematician John Conway, who passed away earlier this week. \n\nConway is best known for his âGame of Lifeâ -   âa never ending  simulation of cell duplication. He was an influence for me, as well as many others in Music ,Art and Games.  In the game, cells can only survive if they can join together. If they do they can create things of wonderful complexity.\n\n While Johnâs cells joined together for survival, we have been forced to distance ourselves. I found this both ironic and tragic. At this time, the hardest thing to keep alive is our sense of self.\n\n This game is not intended to be played for long. Perhaps it isnât a game at all.  It is a space for your thoughts and reflections. You can use it how you like.  I hope you have a great Game Jam.",

Seemed like a good time to combine both.\n\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/1e7/z/2bc65.png)![screen2.png](///raw/1e7/z/2bc67.png)\n\n\nOverall I\u0027m very pleased that I got a compo entry in on time, and with the core loop closed, level and scores and all those bits that make a game, a game. It doesn\u0027t always work out like this!\n\nThat said, there are some janky bits in the animation that given more time, I would sort out. First on my list for improvements though would be adding some feedback when you achieve your objectives, or beat your personal best, and of course having the scores persist between sessions.\n\nThe \"music\" is the laziest composition ever but I wanted to be able to tick the music box. Vangelis I am not.\n\nThere is some humor lurking too if you know where to look, it\u0027s very low key though. The real joke of course is in the source code.\n\nObligatory tech notes:\n\nEngine: Unity3D\nArt: Paint.net\nMusic: https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/",

Instead of a pet, you must keep an adventurer alive while she fights monsters and collects loot.\n\nThe adventurer performs actions herself. As she adventures she will gain gold, which the player can use. However performing actions deplete her resources: HP and hunger. If either resource is completely depleted the adventurer will die â .\n\nYou can replenish her resources by spending gold to play a timed mini-game. You replenish more resources the better you perform in the mini-game.\n\n## Controls\n\n|          | Movement | Action |\n| -------- | -------- | ------- |\n| Keyboard | WASD     | Spacebar |\n| Gamepad  | Left Joystick | A |\n\n![ld46_ss2.png](///raw/873/3/z/2b866.png)\n\n## Tools\n\nEverything was made using the [Pixelbox.js](https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox) game engine.",

        "body":  "Hi, this is my entry for LD46 \"Keep it alive\"!\n\nIn this game you have an aquarium and start with 2 fish. Your job is to keep your fish healthy and alive so they can populate. For that you can give your fish food, a cleaning or repair the oxygen pump! You also can reset the cooldowns, because the more fish you have, the more they need their needs.\n\nControls are fairly simple, click on the icons in the top left to apply one of the effects. The pump has to additionially be clicked with the wrench! \n\nF - fast reset the first cooldown that needs a reset (from left to right)  \nALT - show debug information (some data about fish and pump)  \nM - to unmute/mute music\n\nThe game is over, when you don\u0027t have any fishes anymore.\nAll assets and code have been made by myself, but this time with no sound effects from myself because I thought it would be weird when the fishy sounds everytime something happens.\n\nThanks for reading and playing, if you leave a comment I will definitely check out your game aswell!\n\n![bestgif.gif](///raw/3cd/e/z/2b4d1.gif)",

There are two kinds of enemies in the game: ordinary enemies and sprint enemies\n\n\nSince I donât know art, I used game asset on the Internet, so I had to develop the Jam team.

        "body":  "\n\n[The website will self-destruct](https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com) if you don\u0027t engage with it.\n\nIt\u0027s been a rough month for me, and I\u0027m sure it has for a lot of people.  So I figured, lets create a nice cozy place online where you can write about the issues you\u0027re having.\n\nPlease feel free to read some of the messages that have been left so far, and send one yourself.\n\n--\n\nA little more information about the thought process behind making this, and some of the process after the initial release.\n\nI acknowledge this is about as little of a \u0027game\u0027 as it can come.  \n\nI\u0027d initially come up with the self-destructive website that requires interaction.  Then I was imagining how we could turn that into a game.  My first thought was that this reminds me of something like entering the numbers in Lost, but is more interactive.\n\nI was thinking through interesting things people could do to interact with it.  I\u0027d love to do something that requires getting to a particular location, or performing some tasks.  First I was thinking the system could verify these via an API, but anything interesting that was gamey seemed to go against social distancing guidelines.\n\nThen, I was considering something closer to the Taskmaster #hometasking tasks.  If you\u0027re not aware, there have been tasks every day or two where you have between 5 and 30 hours to complete some task, and take a 20 second video of it.  It\u0027s been a really positive, joyful thing to watch a ton of 20 second clips of people performing silly, funny, entertaining tasks like \u0027turn your bathroom into a fun place to hangout.\u0027\n\nBut after some reflection, they\u0027ve got that covered.  And I encourage you to check it out.\n\nWhat I realized the best thing I could do with the idea, even if it might make it seem less like a game, is to encourage people to write openly and honestly about their lives in a completely ephemeral space.\n\nHonestly, that was my theory, but I wasn\u0027t sure how well people would respond to it, but the responses have been amazing.  I\u0027ve read stories that have been heartbreaking, encouraging, kind, compassionate, and hilarious.  Some people just want to give the website a bit of love, but many many more than I ever could have expected have used it to share something honest.\n\n--\n\nA couple of developer notes and design decisions:\n\nThe Heart button really does record hearts/likes, but this is just kept on the backend.  I\u0027d considered exposing that data, but I don\u0027t think encouraging any kind of \u0027like-hunting\u0027 behavior is necessarily what I\u0027m going for here.  I just want an outlet for sending positivity.  And I think that a broken button doesn\u0027t feel as honest as a real button that\u0027s really doing something.\n\nThe self-destruction mechanism works by checking every page-load that it hasn\u0027t been 24 hours since the last post.  If it has, it immediately deletes all the records in the database.  The counter at the top of the page reflects the real time remaining, and is updated every 90 seconds, so it\u0027ll tick back up after someone posts a new letter.\n\nInitially, I\u0027d planned on only letting you \u0027Read a message\u0027 after sending a message, but shorty after I started testing I realized that it was nice to come back and read a message later.  I could have kept a cookie on someone\u0027s computer, but that felt more invasive than this should be. \n\nI\u0027ve had to build a small moderation tool, since about 5% of the responses are generally hurtful.  I\u0027m not filtering via word choice, since I think it\u0027s reasonable to want to use expletives right now.  Instead, I\u0027m manually reviewing the messages as they come in.\n\nThanks so much for reading.",

The concept is to stay alive as long as you can by spreading the blob to adjacent land tiles. Each tile costs energy to consume, but gives energy back over time from the resources it devours.\n\n## About The Developer\n\n**Giant Blobs From Mars** was developed for Ludum Dare 46 by **Billy McDaniel** under the name of **Almighty Games**. I am known for publishing games on Steam, teaching video game development on Udemy and streaming game design on Twitch. I am currently building an expansive collection of low-poly 3D environment assets which will appear in many of the online marketplaces very soon.\n\nIt\u0027s probably worth mentioning that I am also an accomplished musician and performed and recorded the music tracks for this game as well. The recordings are all first draft, very quick improvisation with all of the slurs and imperfections left in place.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot 2.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd6.png)\n\n![screenshot 4.png](///raw/3ad/02/z/2bbd9.png)\n\n",

Those pesky ants want to destroy your hive and eat all the honey you have produced. You control an assembly of bees, and your goal is a simple one: ***to protect your Queen.*** By defeating ants you render the bee Queen safe and simultaneously *keep it alive*.\n![ss5.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08b.png)\nAbout the game\n====\n![ss7.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2cee9.png)\nChoose from several types of bee units and actions and try to stop swarms of ants from reaching your Queen bee. The game is turn based and requires you to build a simplified economy model in order to provide necessary currency to buy lines of defense. \nSince the game was created solely for Ludum Dare 46 its content is restricted. Nonetheless the player may choose from four units, each having different abilities in order to stop unrelenting hordes of ants. Currently ant enemies come in two variants, differing in health points. \n\nSince there is no tutorial, please refer to the following guide:\n\n* During your turn you can place new units as well as order attacks.\n* During enemy turn the ants move towards the Queen and if they have already encountered a bee, they attack it. The Counterattack of bees is automatic. Beware though, collectors are vulnerable and defenseless!\n* At the beginning of own turn collectors generate honey which acts the in-game currency.\n* You lose if an ant reaches the queen.\n* You win if you survive all waves of enemies.\n* Use left mouse button to choose a unit, then again press left mouse button to place the unit on an empty field. Actions may be performed only on living enemies!\n* Press right mouse button to cancel unit/action selection tool.\n* Every wave there are more of enemies and tougher ants are more common.\n\nPlayable bees:\n\n* collector - a simple drone that has a 50% of generating an unit of honey at the beginning of each turn,\n* beeguard - a powerful defensive unit capable of holding and tackling even toughest enemies,\n* strike unit - a one-use only order to sting a chosen enemy for 1 point of damage,\n* trike team - a devastative attack launched at an enemy of your choosing for 3 damage.\n![ss6.png](///raw/97c/92/z/2c08c.png)\nAbout author\n====\nThe game was created in Unity and Photoshop by me, Ian Burr, an owner of YouTube channel focused on teaching game development and programming.\n\nWARNING\nSince the game is in a somewhat high resolution, the browser version is not displaying correctly. Please refer to downloadable executable for best experience. Now it is fixed, please enter browsers full screen mode for best experience.",

You place turrets along the brainwaves connected to your brain. Once turrets have been placed they can be sold again - however roughly 50% of the value is lost.\n\nThe price when placing turrets is losing focus which together with quality determines your \"Ludum Dare placement\" (rank within the game.\n\nEnemies periodically eat of both quality and focus - especially once they reach your brain.\n\nHave a fantastic day :smile: :sunny: \n\n:purple_heart: :dart: :frog: \n\nCONTROLS:\n\nClicks on the brainwaves once a type is selected constructs a turret in that position.
